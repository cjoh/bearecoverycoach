            <p class="section-subtitle">Traditional certifications teach theory. But the person sitting across from you isn't a textbook. They're a mother who just found pills in her son's backpack. A husband watching his wife disappear. Someone who's been sober for six months and doesn't know what to do with the rage. You need more than theory for that.</p>
