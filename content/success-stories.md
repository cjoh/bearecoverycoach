## They Were Where You Are Now.

Every coach on this page started with the same question: *Can I really do this?*

**Here's what happened when they said yes.**

***

## Ready to Coach After the Weekend Immersion

Most programs make you wait months before you touch a real client. Our coaches start taking clients after the intensive weekend immersion in Weeks 5–8.

By then, you've already practiced with 50+ AI clients. You've worked through simulated cases with trainers. You've gotten written feedback on your coaching. You're not guessing. You're ready.

## From Side Hustle to Six Figures

One of our graduates decided to go full-time with a recovery coaching business after completing the program.

**Year one:** $43,000
**Year two:** $98,000
**Year three:** $201,000

That's not a story about luck. It's a story about what happens when you have a real credential, real skills, professional tools, and a support community that shows up for you every single week.

This coach started exactly where you are right now.

## What Makes the Difference

Our graduates consistently point to the same things:

* **The AI clients** gave them hundreds of practice hours before their first real session. No other program offers this.

* **Simulated cases with trainers** taught them to think on their feet, not memorize scripts they'd forget under pressure.

* **The professional credential** opens doors. Treatment centers hire credentialed coaches. Families trust them.

* **Lifetime weekly support and office hours** mean they're never stuck on a tough case alone. Someone is always there.

## The 75% Stat

Research shows that when people in recovery pair treatment with long-term coaching or case management, their first-year recovery rate reaches 75%. The national average without that support is approximately 40%.

That's the gap recovery coaches fill. And it's why this work matters.
