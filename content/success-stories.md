## Sarah Martinez: From Treatment Center Staff to Full-Time Coach

**Background:** Recovery coordinator at residential treatment facility, 7 years sober

**Before CVR:**
- "I was great at connecting with clients, but I had no coaching framework. I was basically winging it with good intentions."
- Wanted to leave treatment center (burnout) but didn't know how to start private practice
- No credentials, no business plan, scattered approach

**After CVR:**
- Left treatment center 3 months post-graduation
- Built full-time coaching practice (12 active clients)
- ICF ACC credential in progress (halfway through 100 hours)
- **Revenue:** $6,500/month (15 months post-training)
- **Pricing:** $125/session (raised from initial $75)

**What Changed:**

> "The training gave me a coherent methodology. I'm not just 'helping people'—I have a values-driven, identity-focused coaching framework that WORKS. Clients feel the difference. They tell me I'm more structured and intentional than their therapists."

> "Same Page Notes transformed my practice. I look professional. Clients comment on it. I can manage 12 clients without feeling overwhelmed. Before, I maxed out at 4-5 because I was drowning in admin."

**Client Outcomes:**
- 9 of 12 clients (75%) maintain recovery 6+ months
- Average recovery capital score increase: 32%
- 100% client satisfaction (NPS: 9.2/10)

**Advice for New Coaches:**

> "The platform isn't optional—it's essential. Use it from day one. And don't underprice yourself. ICF credential + professional tools = you can charge what therapists charge."

## Michael Thompson, LCSW: Adding Coaching to Therapy Practice

**Background:** Licensed clinical social worker, private practice, 15 years experience

**Why CVR:**
- "Therapy has limitations. Sometimes clients don't need therapy—they need coaching. But I wasn't trained in coaching, so I'd keep them in therapy longer than necessary."
- Wanted ICF credential to add coaching legitimacy
- Interested in family recovery specialization (many clients affected by family member's addiction)

**After CVR:**
- Added "Recovery Coaching" service line to therapy practice
- 8 active coaching clients (in addition to therapy clients)
- ICF ACC credentialed (completed 100 hours post-training)
- **Revenue:** +$3,200/month from coaching (supplemental income)

**What Changed:**

> "CVR taught me coaching skills I never learned in grad school. The distinction between therapy (healing past wounds) and coaching (creating future outcomes) is huge. Now I can offer both."

> "Family recovery coaching is my niche within a niche. Treatment centers refer families to me because I'm one of the few coaches specializing in this. The CVR training + ICF credential opened doors."

**Why Coaching + Therapy Work Together:**

> "With therapy clients, I do deep trauma work. With coaching clients, we focus on values, vision, goals, identity. Different tools for different needs. Some clients graduate from therapy to coaching. Some do both simultaneously (separate sessions). It's not either/or—it's both/and."

**Client Outcomes (Coaching Clients):**
- Faster progress than therapy-only clients
- Higher engagement (coaching feels collaborative, not clinical)
- Better goal achievement rates

**Advice:**

> "If you're a therapist considering coaching, do it. But get proper training. Don't just call therapy 'coaching'—they're distinct skills. CVR gave me the coaching framework I was missing."

## Jennifer Lopez: Career Pivot from Corporate to Full-Time Coach

**Background:** Marketing executive, 12 years sober, no clinical background

**Before CVR:**
- Burned out in corporate
- Wanted meaningful work aligned with values
- Considering therapy grad school (expensive, 3+ years)
- Discovered recovery coaching as alternative path

**Why CVR:**
- ICF-accredited (credibility without grad school)
- 20 weeks vs 3 years
- $1,099 vs $80,000
- Could start coaching immediately post-training

**After CVR:**
- Quit corporate job (planned 6-month runway)
- Built coaching practice faster than expected
- 15 active clients within 6 months
- **Revenue:** $8,100/month (9 months post-graduation)
- **Pricing:** $150/session (premium positioning)

**What Changed:**

> "I didn't need a master's degree to help people. I needed training, tools, and credentials. CVR gave me all three in 20 weeks."

> "My corporate background (marketing, systems, project management) translated perfectly to running a coaching practice. Same Page Notes felt familiar—it's like Asana for coaches. I was operational from day one."

**Business Strategy:**
- Niche: Professional women in recovery (corporate burnout + substances)
- Marketing: LinkedIn content + speaking at recovery events
- Packages: 12-session programs ($1,800)
- Referrals: Therapists, treatment centers, recovery community

**Client Outcomes:**
- 13 of 15 clients (87%) maintain recovery
- Career transitions, relationship healing, value alignment common wins
- Testimonials drive referrals

**Advice:**

> "You don't need clinical training to be an excellent recovery coach. You need lived experience, proper coaching training, and professional tools. CVR provides the training and tools. You bring the experience and heart."

## David Kim: Part-Time Coach While Building Practice

**Background:** Interventionist, 10 years in field, wanted to add coaching services

**Why CVR:**
- Intervention is episodic (one-time crisis work)
- Wanted ongoing client relationships
- Family recovery aligned with intervention work
- ICF credential differentiated him in competitive market

**After CVR:**
- Added coaching to intervention practice
- 6 active coaching clients (part-time, building)
- **Revenue:** +$2,400/month from coaching
- Referral loop: intervention → coaching → ongoing support

**What Changed:**

> "Intervention is intense but brief. Coaching lets me support families long-term. I'm there for the entire journey, not just the crisis. Much more fulfilling."

> "The CVR methodology maps perfectly to post-intervention work. Families need values clarification, vision-setting, awareness-building—exactly what I learned."

**Client Outcomes:**
- Post-intervention coaching → higher treatment completion rates
- Family healing beyond just "getting loved one sober"
- Ongoing support prevents future crises

**Business Model:**
- Intervention (high-touch, high-fee, episodic)
- Coaching (medium-touch, recurring, relational)
- Combined: sustainable income + meaningful impact

**Advice:**

> "If you do intervention work, add coaching. You're already in families' lives at their most vulnerable. Extend that relationship with ongoing support. Families want it, and it's better for outcomes."

## Rachel Green: From Sponsor to Professional Coach

**Background:** 20 years sober, sponsored 30+ women, no formal training

**Before CVR:**
- Sponsored women informally (12-step tradition)
- No compensation, no structure, all volunteer
- Wanted to professionalize but didn't know how
- Concerned about "commodifying recovery" (common fear)

**After CVR:**
- Launched coaching practice (kept sponsorship separate)
- 8 paying clients + still sponsors 4 women (free)
- **Revenue:** $4,000/month (part-time)
- **Pricing:** $100/session

**What Changed:**

> "Coaching isn't sponsorship. I learned that quickly. Sponsorship is working the steps, coach-centered. Coaching is client-driven, goal-oriented, forward-focused. Different tools."

> "I can still sponsor AND coach. They don't conflict. Some women I sponsor for 12-step work, others I coach for life goals. Clear boundaries, no confusion."

**Resolving the "Commodifying Recovery" Concern:**

> "12-step tradition says recovery is freely given. I still honor that—my sponsorship is free. But coaching is a professional service with training, credentials, tools, and outcomes. I'm not charging for recovery; I'm charging for professional coaching. Big difference."

**Client Outcomes:**
- Clients report coaching feels more collaborative than sponsorship
- Goal achievement (career, relationships, personal growth)
- Coaching complements (doesn't replace) 12-step work

**Advice:**

> "If you sponsor, you can coach too. Just keep them separate. And charge what you're worth—professional coaching has value beyond freely-given sponsorship."

## Common Themes Across All Graduates

### What Works:

1. **Use the platform from day one** (Same Page Notes = competitive advantage)
2. **Don't underprice** (ICF + professional tools = therapist-level pricing)
3. **Niche down** (family recovery, professional women, interventionists, etc.)
4. **Leverage referral networks** (treatment centers, therapists, alumni)
5. **Invest in business skills** (marketing, systems, packaging)

### What Doesn't Work:

1. Trying to DIY everything (platform saves hours/week)
2. Generic "recovery coach" positioning (niche wins)
3. Undervaluing your services (cheap = unprofessional signal)
4. Isolating (alumni network prevents burnout)
5. Wing-it approach (methodology matters)
