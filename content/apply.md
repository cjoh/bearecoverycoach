## Your 3-Step Path to Getting Started

### Step 1: Apply (5 Minutes)

Fill out the short form below. Tell us about yourself and why recovery coaching matters to you. No essays, no trick questions.

### Step 2: Interview (Get to Know Each Other)

We'll schedule a brief conversation with Clay. This isn't a test. It's a chance for us to learn about your goals and for you to ask questions. We want to make sure this is the right fit for both of us.

### Step 3: Start Training

Secure your spot, receive your welcome packet, and join your cohort. You'll begin working with trainers on simulated cases from day one.

## Not Sure If You're Ready?

**That's completely normal.** Every coach in our program felt the same way before they applied. Here's what we hear most:

### "I don't have enough experience."

You don't need clinical credentials or years of professional coaching. Many of our strongest graduates come from lived recovery experience, family recovery, or adjacent fields. The program teaches you everything you need. That's the point.

### "I'm not sure I can afford it."

The full program is **$2,379**. Payment plans are available. Compare that to a graduate degree ($60,000+) or other certification programs that don't include AI practice tools, lifetime support, or a pathway to accredited credentials.

### "What if I'm not good at coaching?"

That's exactly what the 50+ AI clients are for. You'll practice with simulated clients who give you honest, real-time feedback. You'll work through cases with your trainers. By graduation, you'll have more practice hours than most new coaches get in their first year.

### "I don't know if now is the right time."

There's never a perfect time. But there are 23 million Americans in recovery, and millions of families affected by addiction, who need qualified coaches right now. The demand isn't slowing down.
