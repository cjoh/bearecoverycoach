**You want to help people in recovery. You also want to pay your bills.**

There's no shame in asking the money question. If you're considering recovery coaching as a career — or you're already coaching and wondering whether you're leaving money on the table — you deserve real numbers, not vague promises.

This guide gives you exactly that: actual salary data, honest income scenarios, and a clear picture of what's possible at every stage of your career.

**Here's what we'll cover:**

* Average recovery coach salaries (2026 data)

* Hourly rates by experience level

* Part-time vs full-time income

* How credentials affect what you can charge

* Geographic variations

* Business models (employed vs private practice)

## Quick Answer: Recovery Coach Salary Range

**Part-Time Recovery Coaches (5–10 clients):**

* $1,500–$4,000/month

* $18,000–$48,000/year

**Full-Time Recovery Coaches (15–20 clients):**

* $5,000–$12,000/month

* $60,000–$144,000/year

**Employed Recovery Coaches (Treatment Centers, etc.):**

* $40,000–$65,000/year salary

* Benefits included

**Private Practice (Experienced, ICF-Credentialed):**

* $75,000–$150,000/year

* No benefits, higher rates

These ranges are wide because your income depends on a few key factors: credentials, experience, business model, and location. Let's break each one down.

***

## Hourly Rates: What Recovery Coaches Actually Charge

### By Experience Level

**New Coaches (0–1 year):**

* **Range:** $50–100/session

* **Average:** $75/session

* **Why lower:** You're building your reputation. Clients don't know you yet.

**Emerging Coaches (1–3 years):**

* **Range:** $100–150/session

* **Average:** $125/session

* **Why higher:** You have client results to point to. Word-of-mouth is working.

**Experienced Coaches (3–5 years):**

* **Range:** $150–200/session

* **Average:** $175/session

* **Why highest:** Proven outcomes, strong referral network, premium positioning.

**Master Coaches (5+ years, ICF PCC/MCC):**

* **Range:** $200–300/session

* **Average:** $250/session

* **Why premium:** Deep experience, advanced credentials, specialization, and a track record that speaks for itself.

### By Credential

Your credential is the single fastest lever for raising your rates. Here's how they break down:

**No Credential:**

* $50–75/session

* Limited to peer support and informal coaching

* Difficult to land treatment center contracts

**Basic Certification (Non-ICF):**

* $75–100/session

* Peer recovery specialist, CARC, etc.

* Some legitimacy, but not ICF standard

**ICF ACC (Associate Certified Coach):**

* $100–150/session

* **+33–50% over non-credentialed coaches**

* Treatment centers hire you. Families trust you.

**ICF PCC (Professional Certified Coach):**

* $175–250/session

* **+75–100% over non-credentialed**

* Premium positioning and advanced skills

**Specialization (Family Recovery, Trauma, etc.):**

* **+$25–50/session** on top of your base rate

* Niche expertise commands a premium every time

## Geographic Salary Variations

Where you live — and where your clients live — matters. But virtual coaching is changing the game.

### High-Income Markets

**Major metros (NYC, SF, LA, Boston, Seattle):**

* **Rates:** $150–300/session

* **Annual:** $80,000–150,000 (full-time)

* **Why higher:** High cost of living, premium clients, insurance coverage more common

### Mid-Market Cities

**Mid-size cities (Denver, Austin, Portland, Nashville):**

* **Rates:** $100–200/session

* **Annual:** $60,000–100,000 (full-time)

* **Why moderate:** Balanced cost of living, growing recovery infrastructure

### Rural/Small Markets

**Rural areas, small towns:**

* **Rates:** $50–125/session

* **Annual:** $30,000–75,000 (full-time)

* **Why lower:** Lower cost of living, less disposable income, fewer treatment centers nearby

### Virtual/Online Coaching (Location-Independent)

**Serve clients anywhere:**

* **Rates:** $100–200/session (you charge based on YOUR expertise, not your client's zip code)

* **Annual:** $60,000–120,000 (full-time)

* **Advantage:** Access higher-paying markets without living there

This is where recovery coaching gets interesting. You can live in a low-cost area and serve clients in premium markets — all from your home office.

## How to Increase Your Recovery Coach Income

You don't have to wait years to earn more. Here are six strategies that work, ranked by impact.

### 1. Get ICF Credentialed

**Impact:** +$25–50/session

**ROI of Core Values Recovery Coach training:**

* Training cost: $2,379

* Increased revenue: $25/session x 40 sessions/month = $1,000/month

* **Payback period: just over 1 month**

**Long-term:** $12,000+/year income increase

This is the highest-leverage move on the list. An ICF ACC-based credential immediately separates you from the crowd.

### 2. Specialize (Niche Down)

**Generic "recovery coach":** $75–100/session

**Specialized:**

* Family recovery coach: $125–150/session

* Trauma-informed recovery coach: $150–175/session

* Executive recovery coach: $200–300/session

**Impact:** +$25–100/session

When you serve everyone, you stand out to no one. Pick a niche and own it.

### 3. Package Your Services

**Instead of:** $150/session a la carte

**Offer:**

* 12-session package: $1,800 ($150/session, paid upfront)

* 6-month program (24 sessions): $3,000 ($125/session, but guaranteed income)

**Benefits:**

* Predictable income

* Higher commitment from clients

* Better outcomes (longer engagement = deeper work)

### 4. Add Group Coaching

**1-on-1 coaching:** $150/session, 1 client = $150

**Group coaching:** $50/person, 8 people = $400/session

**Same time investment, 2.6x revenue.**

**Popular groups:**

* Family members navigating a loved one's addiction

* Early recovery support groups

* Professional development for other coaches

### 5. Create Passive Income

**Digital products:**

* Courses: $200–500

* Workbooks: $20–50

* Membership community: $30–100/month

**Example:**

* 50 course sales/year x $300 = $15,000 passive income

* Supplements your coaching income without adding hours

### 6. Partner with Treatment Centers

**Referral agreements:**

* Treatment center refers clients post-discharge

* You provide ongoing coaching

* They get continuity of care. You get clients.

**Contract coaching:**

* Center hires you for alumni support (monthly retainer)

* Guaranteed income, less marketing needed

***

## Income Breakdown: Expenses to Consider

If you go the self-employed route, your gross revenue is not your take-home pay. Here's what the real numbers look like.

**Business Expenses (~20-30% of revenue):**

* Professional liability insurance: $200–500/year

* ICF membership: $270/year

* Platform/tools: $0–600/year (Core Values Recovery Coach graduates get access to coaching tools)

* Marketing: $500–2,000/year

* Continuing education: $500–1,500/year

* Office/Zoom subscription: $200/year

* Accounting/legal: $500–1,000/year

**Taxes (~25-30% of revenue):**

* Self-employment tax (15.3%)

* Federal income tax (10-24% depending on bracket)

* State income tax (varies)

**Example:**

* Gross revenue: $75,000/year

* Business expenses: -$7,500 (10%)

* Taxes: -$18,750 (25%)

* **Net income: $48,750**

**Compare to employed:**

* Salary: $52,000

* Taxes: -$10,400 (20%, employer pays half)

* **Net income: $41,600**

Private practice can earn more — but don't forget to account for expenses when you're comparing options.

## Can You Make Six Figures as a Recovery Coach?

**Yes.** But you should know what it takes:

### 1. Experience (3–5 years minimum)

You can't charge $200+/session without a track record. That's true in any coaching field.

### 2. ICF PCC Credential

Premium pricing requires premium credentials. The Core Values Recovery Coach training puts you on a professional credential path — advanced credentials come with experience and continued development.

### 3. Specialization

Generic doesn't command premium. Niche does. Pick the population you care most about — individuals in early recovery, families navigating addiction, executives protecting their careers — and go deep.

### 4. Business Skills

Marketing, sales, systems — you're running a business, not just coaching clients. The coaches earning six figures treat it like one.

### 5. High Volume OR High Rates

**Option A:** 40 sessions/month x $150 = $72,000/year
**Option B:** 25 sessions/month x $250 = $75,000/year

**Option C:** 30 sessions/month x $200 + group coaching + digital products = $100,000+/year

Most six-figure coaches use some version of Option C.

| Life Coach (Generic)      | $30,000–100,000 | None required          | No       |

**What stands out about recovery coaching:**

* Faster to start than therapy (months vs years)

* Comparable income to entry-level therapists

* Lower barrier to entry

* More scalable (groups, digital products, packages)

If you want to help people in recovery and you don't want to spend six years in grad school first, this career path deserves a serious look.

***

## Is Recovery Coaching Worth It Financially?

Let's compare the two paths side by side.

**Traditional Career Path (Therapist):**

* Time: 6 years (Master's + supervised hours)

* Cost: $80,000 (tuition + living expenses)

* Debt: $50,000+ average

* Starting salary: $50,000

**Recovery Coach Path (Core Values Recovery Coach):**

* Time: 6–12 months (training + building your practice)

* Cost: $2,379

* Debt: $0

* First-year income: $20,000–40,000 (part-time)

**Break-even:**

* Therapist: 8–10 years to pay off debt

* Recovery coach: Profitable from month 1

**Income ceiling:**

* Therapist: $75,000–100,000 (often capped by insurance rates)

* Recovery coach: $60,000–150,000+ (you set your rates)

**The financial verdict:** Recovery coaching offers faster ROI, comparable income, and more flexibility. It's not the right path for everyone — but if you're drawn to this work, the economics are strongly in your favor.
