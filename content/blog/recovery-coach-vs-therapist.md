Maybe you're in recovery and wondering who can actually help you move forward. Maybe you're watching someone you love struggle and you're exhausted from trying to figure it out alone. Or maybe you've been in therapy for a while and feel stuck — like you've done the healing work, but you still don't have a plan for what comes next.

Here's what most people don't realize: recovery coaches and therapists do fundamentally different things. And understanding that difference could be the thing that finally gets you — or someone you care about — unstuck.

**This guide walks you through:**

* What recovery coaches do (vs what therapists do)

* Training and credentials for each

* When you need one, the other, or both

* Why they work better together

* Cost differences

## What Recovery Coaches Do

Recovery coaches meet you where you are and help you get where you want to go. They don't dwell on what went wrong. They focus on what you're building next.

### 1. Create Vision and Goals

**Not:** "Let's process why you drink."
**Instead:** "What do you want your life to look like in recovery?"

**Tools:**

* Vision-setting exercises

* Values clarification

* Goal-setting frameworks

* Life design planning

**What this looks like in practice:**
You want to rebuild your relationship with your daughter. Your coach helps you map out specific steps, set a realistic timeline, and build an accountability structure so you actually follow through.

### 2. Build Awareness and Identify Patterns

**Not:** Deep trauma processing.
**Instead:** "What triggers your stress? How do you respond? What's the pattern?"

**Tools:**

* Self-awareness exercises

* Pattern recognition

* Committee thinking (identifying your internal voices)

* Mindfulness practices

**What this looks like in practice:**
You notice you isolate when you're stressed. Your coach helps you spot the early warning signs before they spiral and create specific strategies for intervention.

### 3. Take Action and Stay Accountable

**Not:** Endless conversation about problems.
**Instead:** "What will you do this week? How will we know you did it?"

**Tools:**

* Action planning

* Weekly check-ins

* Obstacle anticipation

* Progress tracking

**What this looks like in practice:**
You commit to three meetings this week. Your coach follows up, celebrates wins, and helps you problem-solve the barriers that got in the way.

### 4. Navigate Relationships and Systems

**Not:** Family therapy (processing old wounds together).
**Instead:** "How do you want to show up in your relationships starting now?"

**Tools:**

* Communication strategies

* Boundary-setting frameworks

* Conflict resolution approaches

* Family dynamics awareness

**What this looks like in practice:**
You're learning to set boundaries with an enabling parent. Your coach role-plays the conversations with you and gives you frameworks you can use in the moment.

### 5. Maintain Long-Term Recovery

**Not:** Crisis intervention.
**Instead:** Ongoing support, check-ins, and course corrections as life evolves.

**Tools:**

* Recovery capital assessment

* Relapse prevention planning

* Lifestyle design

* Community connection

**What this looks like in practice:**
You're two years sober and feeling complacent. Your coach helps you deepen your recovery, find new challenges, and stay ahead of relapse before it becomes a risk.

## What Therapists Do

Therapists help you heal what's underneath. They're trained clinicians who can diagnose, treat, and help you process the things that drove your addiction in the first place.

### 1. Heal Past Trauma

**Focus:** Processing childhood wounds, abuse, addiction history

**Tools:**

* EMDR (trauma reprocessing)

* CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy)

* Psychodynamic therapy

* Attachment work

**What this looks like in practice:**
You're processing sexual abuse that contributed to your substance use. Your therapist guides the trauma healing work in a clinically safe environment.

### 2. Treat Mental Health Conditions

**Therapists can diagnose and treat:**

* Depression

* Anxiety disorders

* PTSD

* Personality disorders

* Co-occurring disorders

**Tools:**

* Clinical assessment

* Evidence-based treatments

* Medication coordination (with psychiatrist)

* Safety planning

**What this looks like in practice:**
You have co-occurring depression and addiction. Your therapist treats both and coordinates with your psychiatrist on medication.

### 3. Develop Coping Skills

**Focus:** Managing symptoms, regulating emotions, reducing harm

**Tools:**

* DBT skills (distress tolerance, emotion regulation)

* Mindfulness-based stress reduction

* Relapse prevention therapy

* Crisis intervention

**What this looks like in practice:**
You're having panic attacks. Your therapist teaches you breathing techniques, cognitive reframing, and exposure therapy to manage them.

### 4. Process Grief and Loss

**Focus:** Death, divorce, job loss, identity loss

**Tools:**

* Grief counseling

* Existential therapy

* Narrative therapy

* Support through stages of grief

**What this looks like in practice:**
You're grieving the loss of your drinking friends, your old identity as "the life of the party." Your therapist helps you process that loss and find new meaning.

### 5. Provide Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Plans

**Therapists are licensed to:**

* Diagnose mental health conditions

* Create clinical treatment plans

* Document for insurance

* Coordinate care with medical providers

**What this looks like in practice:**
You need insurance coverage for treatment. Your therapist provides the diagnosis, treatment plan, and ongoing documentation required.

## Key Differences Explained

### 1. Direction of Focus

**Recovery Coach — Future-Focused:**

* "Where do you want to go?"

* "Who do you want to become?"

* "What actions will get you there?"

**Therapist — Past and Present-Focused:**

* "What happened to you?"

* "How are you coping now?"

* "Let's heal these wounds."

**Think of it this way:**
Your coach is a GPS — charting the path forward. Your therapist is a mechanic — repairing what's broken under the hood. You need the car running AND you need to know where you're going.

### 2. Nature of the Relationship

**Recovery Coach — Partnership:**

* Collaborative, equal footing

* "We're in this together"

* Coach may share lived experience

* Informal, conversational

* You are the expert on your life

**Therapist — Clinical Boundary:**

* Professional distance maintained

* "I'm here to help you"

* Therapist rarely shares personal experience

* Formal, structured

* Therapist is the expert on treatment

Neither is better. They serve different purposes.

### 3. Training and Credentials

**Recovery Coach:**

* **Training:** 60-125 hours (ICF-based programs)

* **Credentials:** ICF ACC/PCC (optional but increasingly valuable)

* **License:** Not required

* **Education:** Often lived experience plus coaching training

* **Specialization:** Recovery, addiction, family systems

* **Time to practice:** 6-12 months

**Therapist:**

* **Training:** Master's degree (2-3 years) plus supervised hours (2+ years)

* **Credentials:** LCSW, LPC, LMFT, psychologist, etc.

* **License:** Required to practice

* **Education:** Clinical psychology, social work, counseling

* **Specialization:** Varies (trauma, addiction, family therapy, etc.)

* **Time to practice:** 4-6 years

### 4. Scope of Practice

**Recovery Coach CAN:**

* Help set goals and create action plans

* Provide accountability and ongoing support

* Teach skills like communication and boundary-setting

* Facilitate self-awareness and pattern recognition

* Connect you to resources (meetings, treatment, community)

**Recovery Coach CANNOT:**

* Diagnose mental health conditions

* Provide clinical treatment

* Process deep trauma

* Bill insurance (usually — exceptions are emerging)

* Prescribe medication

**Therapist CAN:**

* Diagnose mental health conditions

* Provide evidence-based clinical treatment

* Process trauma at depth

* Bill insurance

* Coordinate with psychiatrists for medication

**Therapist CANNOT:**

* Prescribe medication (except psychiatrists)

* Typically provide ongoing accountability between sessions

* Work outside clinical scope (coaching requires different training)

### 5. Cost and Insurance

**Recovery Coach:**

* **Cost:** $75-200/session

* **Insurance:** Rarely covered (but this is changing)

* **Payment:** Usually out-of-pocket

* **Frequency:** Flexible — weekly, biweekly, monthly, or as needed

**Therapist:**

* **Cost:** $100-250/session

* **Insurance:** Often covered (check your plan)

* **Payment:** Insurance plus copay, or out-of-pocket

* **Frequency:** Usually weekly (insurance may dictate schedule)

**The real math:**
Coaching is often more affordable long-term because there's no insurance paperwork and you control the frequency. Therapy can be cheaper per session if insurance covers it, but comes with more limitations on scheduling and duration.

## When to Use a Recovery Coach

A recovery coach is right for you when you're past the crisis and ready to build.

### 1. You're Stable and Want to Grow

You're not in crisis. You're not actively using. Your mental health is managed. Now you want to build a life worth living.

**You want help with:**

* Creating a vision for life in recovery

* Setting and achieving meaningful goals

* Staying accountable to yourself

* Navigating relationships with new skills

* Designing a sustainable daily life

**What this looks like:** You're six months sober, attending meetings, in stable housing. You're ready to rebuild your career, your relationships, and your sense of purpose.

### 2. You Need Ongoing Support After Treatment

You completed inpatient or outpatient. Now you're back in the real world.

**You want help with:**

* Bridging the gap from treatment to everyday life

* Accountability between therapy sessions

* Implementing what you learned in treatment

* Navigating triggers, stress, and temptation day by day

**What this looks like:** You just finished a 30-day program. Your therapist sees you weekly. Your coach checks in twice a week, provides text support, and holds you accountable to your recovery plan.

### 3. Your Family Needs Support

You're the parent, spouse, or sibling of someone in addiction. You're not the one using — but you're the one suffering.

**You want help with:**

* Setting real boundaries (and holding them)

* Stopping enabling behaviors

* Taking care of yourself

* Navigating complex family dynamics

* Supporting without controlling

**What this looks like:** You're the parent of an adult child in active addiction. Your coach helps you detach with love, set boundaries that stick, and find your own support through Al-Anon or other resources.

### 4. You Want Practical, Action-Oriented Support

Talking is helpful. But you need to DO something.

**You want help with:**

* Weekly action plans you actually follow

* Accountability check-ins that keep you honest

* Problem-solving specific obstacles

* Celebrating wins (because nobody else might)

* Course corrections when life throws curveballs

**What this looks like:** You're committed to recovery and clear on what you need to do — meetings, therapy, exercise, connection. But you struggle with follow-through. Your coach provides the accountability structure that keeps you on track.

### 5. You're Building a Life, Not Just Stopping a Behavior

Recovery is not just "not using." It's creating a life with meaning, purpose, and connection.

**You want help with:**

* Discovering your values, purpose, and identity beyond addiction

* Setting career, relationship, and personal goals

* Building recovery capital — the internal and external resources that sustain you

* Designing a life you don't want to escape from

**What this looks like:** You're two years sober. You're no longer "fighting addiction." Now you're asking: "What do I want to build?"

***

## When to Use a Therapist

A therapist is right for you when there's clinical work to be done — trauma to heal, conditions to treat, or a crisis to stabilize.

### 1. You Have Co-Occurring Mental Health Conditions

Depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, or other diagnoses alongside addiction.

**You need:**

* Clinical diagnosis

* Evidence-based treatment

* Medication coordination (with psychiatrist)

* Insurance coverage for ongoing care

**What this looks like:** You have anxiety and alcohol use disorder. You can't address one without addressing the other. Your therapist treats both.

### 2. You're Processing Trauma

Childhood abuse, domestic violence, combat, sexual assault — the wounds underneath the addiction.

**You need:**

* Trauma-informed therapy (EMDR, CPT, PE)

* A safe clinical space to process

* Expertise in trauma healing

**What this looks like:** You were drinking to numb memories of childhood sexual abuse. Your therapist guides the trauma processing work that no amount of coaching can replace.

### 3. You're in Crisis or at High Risk

Suicidal ideation, active psychosis, severe withdrawal, or immediate danger.

**You need:**

* Clinical assessment

* Safety planning

* Possible hospitalization coordination

* Crisis intervention

**What this looks like:** Your suicidal thoughts are increasing. Your therapist assesses your safety, creates a plan, and coordinates a higher level of care if needed.

### 4. You Need Insurance Coverage

You can't afford out-of-pocket services. You need your insurance to pay.

**A therapist can:**

* Provide a clinical diagnosis for insurance

* Bill insurance directly

* Document medical necessity

* Coordinate with your insurance company

**What this looks like:** Your budget is tight. Insurance covers therapy after your copay. Coaching would be entirely out-of-pocket — and right now, that's not feasible.

### 5. You're in the Acute Phase of Recovery

The first 30-90 days. High relapse risk. Everything feels unstable.

**You need:**

* Frequent clinical support

* Relapse prevention therapy

* Coping skill development

* Connection to treatment resources

**What this looks like:** You just detoxed. The risk of relapse is high. Weekly therapy plus intensive outpatient gives you the clinical foundation. A coach can layer on top when you're ready.

## Why Recovery Coaches and Therapists Work Better Together

This is not an either/or decision. The best outcomes happen when you use both.

### The Complementary Model

**Your therapist (weekly):**

* Processes trauma and manages mental health

* Develops clinical coping skills

* Heals past wounds

* Provides clinical diagnosis and treatment

**Your recovery coach (2x/week or flexible):**

* Implements therapy insights into daily life

* Holds you accountable for action steps

* Builds your future vision

* Navigates relationships and practical challenges

**Together, you get:**

* Faster progress

* Better outcomes

* More comprehensive support

* Significantly lower relapse risk

### Real Example: Sarah's Recovery Journey

**Sarah, 35. Alcohol use disorder, depression, childhood trauma.**

**What her therapist did (weekly):**

* EMDR for trauma processing

* CBT for depression

* Medication coordination with psychiatrist

* Clinical treatment plan and documentation

**What her recovery coach did (2x/week):**

* Daily accountability for sobriety

* Goal-setting for career, relationships, and health

* Navigating boundaries with her enabling mother

* Meeting attendance support

* Life design planning

**The result:**

* 18 months sober (her previous longest streak was 60 days)

* Depression managed through therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes

* Rebuilt relationship with her sister

* New job aligned with her values

* A sustainable recovery lifestyle she actually wants to live

**In Sarah's words:**

> "Therapy healed my past. Coaching built my future. I needed both."

***

## Can Therapists Also Coach?

Yes — but coaching is a distinct skill set, not a subset of therapy.

**Some therapists:**

* Get additional coach training through ICF-based programs

* Offer both therapy AND coaching as separate services

* Use a coaching approach with clients who are clinically appropriate

**The key distinction:**

* **Therapy client:** Clinical diagnosis, treatment plan, processing past wounds

* **Coaching client:** No diagnosis needed, forward-focused, action-oriented

**The same person can use both services:**

* Start with therapy (heal trauma, stabilize mental health)

* Transition to coaching (build vision, set goals, take action)

* Or do both simultaneously in separate sessions

**Example: Michael, LCSW and ICF ACC**

> "I'm a licensed therapist AND an ICF-certified coach. With therapy clients, I do trauma work, treat depression, process grief. With coaching clients, we set goals, create action plans, build accountability. Different tools, different outcomes. Both valuable."

***

## How to Choose: Questions to Ask Yourself

**A recovery coach may be right for you if:**

* You're stable (not in crisis)

* Your mental health conditions are managed

* You want practical, action-oriented support

* You're ready to build your future, not just process your past

* You value frequent accountability and check-ins

* You can pay out-of-pocket (or find a coach who accepts insurance)

**A therapist may be right for you if:**

* You have co-occurring mental health conditions

* You're processing trauma

* You're in crisis or at high risk

* You need insurance coverage

* You need clinical diagnosis and treatment

* You're in the first 90 days of recovery

**Consider BOTH if:**

* You have complex needs (trauma AND goals)

* You want comprehensive, wraparound support

* Your budget allows it (insurance for therapy, out-of-pocket for coaching)

* You're serious about building long-term, sustainable recovery

## Common Myths Debunked

**Myth 1: "Coaches are just unlicensed therapists."**
Recovery coaching is a distinct profession with its own training, ethics, methodology, and outcomes. Coaches don't do therapy. They do coaching. Different skill set, different purpose, different results.

**Myth 2: "Therapy is better because it requires a license."**
Licensing ensures clinical competence. Coaching competence is measured differently — through ICF credentials, training hours, and demonstrated results. Both are valuable. They solve different problems.

**Myth 3: "You should 'graduate' from therapy to coaching."**
Some people do transition from therapy to coaching. Others use both simultaneously. Others go back and forth depending on what's happening in their life. There's no hierarchy — just different tools for different seasons.

**Myth 4: "Coaches are cheaper but less effective."**
Different tools for different jobs. Coaching is highly effective for goal-setting, accountability, and action. Therapy is highly effective for trauma healing and mental health treatment. Cost has nothing to do with quality.

**Myth 5: "I can only afford one, so I have to choose."**
If budget is tight, prioritize based on your current needs. Crisis, trauma, or unmanaged mental health? Start with a therapist. Stable and ready to grow? A coach can make a huge difference. Ideally, you work toward having both.

## The Future: Insurance Coverage for Recovery Coaching

**Where things stand today:** Most insurance plans don't cover coaching.

**What's changing:**

* Some insurance companies are piloting coaching coverage

* ICF-credentialed coaches are increasingly recognized by payers

* Employer wellness benefits are beginning to include coaching

* Recovery coaching specifically is gaining traction as an evidence-based service

**What you can do now:**

* Ask your insurance company if they cover recovery coaching

* Check whether your employer offers wellness coaching benefits

* Look into using FSA/HSA for coaching expenses (some plans allow it)

* Advocate for coverage — the more people ask, the faster insurers respond

***

### The Bottom Line

**Recovery coaches and therapists serve different — but complementary — purposes.**

**Your therapist** heals the past, treats clinical conditions, and processes trauma.
**Your coach** builds the future, drives accountability, and helps you take action.

**The best outcomes happen when you have both.**

If you're trying to decide, start with what you need most right now. You can always add the other later.

## Interested in Becoming a Recovery Coach?

If you're reading this and thinking about the other side of the equation — if you're a therapist who wants to add coaching to your practice, or someone with lived experience who wants to help others professionally — this could be your path.

Recovery coaching is one of the fastest-growing careers in behavioral health. And the demand far outpaces the supply of trained, credentialed coaches.

### Core Values Recovery Coach Training

The Core Values Recovery Coach certification is an ICF ACC based program designed to give you everything you need to start coaching individuals and families in recovery — with real skills, not scripts.

**What makes it different:**

* **ICF ACC Based Program** — Built on the gold standard in coaching credentials, so your training is recognized and respected

* **Practice with 50+ AI clients** — Simulated clients who give you real feedback, so you build genuine coaching skills before you ever work with a live client

* **Simulated Cases with Trainers** — You learn by working through realistic scenarios alongside experienced trainers, not by memorizing scripts

* **Intervention Techniques** — Learn the basics of intervention so you can support families in crisis, not just individuals in recovery

* **Individuals AND Families** — You'll be trained to serve the person in recovery and the people who love them

* **Lifetime Weekly Support** — After certification, you get weekly support calls and office hours for life (as long as you maintain your credential)

* **Professional Platform** — Everything you need to launch and run your coaching practice

You don't just get a certificate. You get the skills, the practice, the tools, and a community that supports you for the long haul.
