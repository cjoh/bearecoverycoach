## What Recovery Coaches Do

**Recovery coaches help clients:**

### 1. Create Vision & Goals

**Not:** "Let's process why you drink"  
**But:** "What do you want your life to look like in recovery?"

**Tools:**
- Vision-setting exercises
- Values clarification
- Goal-setting frameworks
- Life design planning

**Example:**  
Client wants to rebuild relationship with daughter. Coach helps create specific steps, timeline, accountability structure.

### 2. Build Awareness & Identify Patterns

**Not:** Deep trauma processing  
**But:** "What triggers stress? How do you respond? What's the pattern?"

**Tools:**
- Self-awareness exercises
- Pattern recognition
- Committee thinking (internal voices)
- Mindfulness practices

**Example:**  
Client notices they isolate when stressed. Coach helps identify early warning signs, create intervention strategies.

### 3. Take Action & Stay Accountable

**Not:** Endless talking about problems  
**But:** "What will you do this week? How will I know you did it?"

**Tools:**
- Action planning
- Weekly check-ins
- Obstacle anticipation
- Progress tracking

**Example:**  
Client commits to 3 meetings this week. Coach follows up, celebrates wins, problem-solves barriers.

### 4. Navigate Relationships & Systems

**Not:** Family therapy (processing past hurts)  
**But:** "How do you want to show up in your relationships now?"

**Tools:**
- Communication strategies
- Boundary-setting
- Conflict resolution
- Family dynamics awareness

**Example:**  
Client learning to set boundaries with enabling parent. Coach role-plays conversations, provides frameworks.

### 5. Maintain Long-Term Recovery

**Not:** Crisis intervention  
**But:** Ongoing support, check-ins, course corrections

**Tools:**
- Recovery capital assessment
- Relapse prevention planning
- Lifestyle design
- Community connection

**Example:**  
Client 2 years sober, feeling complacent. Coach helps deepen recovery, find new challenges, avoid relapse.

**Tools:**
- DBT skills (distress tolerance, emotion regulation)
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction
- Relapse prevention therapy

## Key Differences Explained

### 1. Direction of Focus

**Recovery Coach: Future-Focused**
- "Where do you want to go?"
- "Who do you want to become?"
- "What actions will get you there?"

**Therapist: Past + Present-Focused**
- "What happened to you?"
- "How are you coping now?"
- "Let's heal these wounds"

**Metaphor:**
- Coach = GPS (charting path forward)
- Therapist = Mechanic (repairing what's broken)

### 2. Nature of Relationship

**Recovery Coach: Partnership**
- Collaborative, equal footing
- "We're in this together"
- Coach may share lived experience
- Informal, conversational
- Client is expert on their life

**Therapist: Clinical Boundary**
- Professional distance maintained
- "I'm here to help you"
- Therapist rarely shares personal experience
- Formal, structured
- Therapist is expert on treatment

**Neither is better—they serve different purposes.**

### 3. Training & Credentials

**Recovery Coach:**
- **Training:** 60-125 hours (ICF programs)
- **Credentials:** ICF ACC/PCC (optional but valuable)
- **License:** Not required
- **Education:** Often lived experience + coaching training
- **Specialization:** Recovery, addiction, family systems

**Therapist:**
- **Training:** Master's degree (2-3 years) + supervised hours (2+ years)
- **Credentials:** LCSW, LPC, LMFT, psychologist, etc.
- **License:** Required to practice
- **Education:** Clinical psychology, social work, counseling
- **Specialization:** Varies (trauma, addiction, family therapy, etc.)

**Time to practice:**
- Coach: 6-12 months
- Therapist: 4-6 years

### 4. What They Can and Can't Do

**Recovery Coach CAN:**
- ✅ Help set goals and create action plans
- ✅ Provide accountability and support
- ✅ Teach skills (communication, boundary-setting, etc.)
- ✅ Facilitate self-awareness
- ✅ Connect to resources (meetings, treatment, etc.)

**Recovery Coach CANNOT:**
- ❌ Diagnose mental health conditions
- ❌ Provide clinical treatment

- ❌ Bill insurance (usually—exceptions emerging)
- ❌ Prescribe medication

**Therapist CAN:**
- ✅ Diagnose mental health conditions
- ✅ Provide evidence-based clinical treatment
- ✅ Process trauma deeply
- ✅ Bill insurance
- ✅ Coordinate with psychiatrists for medication

**Therapist CANNOT:**
- ❌ Prescribe medication (except psychiatrists)
- ❌ Typically provide ongoing accountability (session-focused)
- ❌ Work outside clinical scope (coaching is different skill set)

### 5. Cost & Insurance

**Recovery Coach:**
- **Cost:** $75-200/session
- **Insurance:** Rarely covered (but changing)
- **Payment:** Usually out-of-pocket
- **Frequency:** Flexible (weekly, biweekly, monthly)

**Therapist:**
- **Cost:** $100-250/session
- **Insurance:** Often covered (check plan)
- **Payment:** Insurance + copay OR out-of-pocket
- **Frequency:** Usually weekly (insurance may dictate)

**Value calculation:**
- Coach: Often more affordable long-term (no insurance paperwork, flexible frequency)
- Therapist: Insurance coverage can make it cheaper (but comes with limitations)

## When to Use a Recovery Coach

**Best for:**

### 1. You're Stable and Want to Grow

**Not in crisis, not actively using, mental health managed.**

**You want:**
- Build vision for life in recovery
- Set and achieve goals
- Maintain accountability
- Navigate relationships
- Design sustainable lifestyle

**Example:**  
6 months sober, attending meetings, stable housing. Ready to rebuild career, relationships, sense of purpose.

### 2. You Need Ongoing Support Post-Treatment

**Completed inpatient/outpatient, back to "real life."**

**You want:**
- Bridge from treatment to everyday recovery
- Accountability between therapy sessions
- Help implementing what you learned
- Support navigating triggers, stress, temptation

**Example:**  
Discharged from 30-day rehab. Therapist is weekly. Coach provides 2x/week check-ins, text support, accountability.

### 3. Your Family Needs Support (Not the Person in Addiction)

**You're the parent, spouse, sibling of someone in addiction.**

**You want:**
- Set boundaries
- Stop enabling
- Take care of yourself
- Navigate complex family dynamics
- Support without controlling

**Example:**  
Parent of adult child in active addiction. Coach helps parent detach with love, set boundaries, find Al-Anon support.

### 4. You Want Practical, Action-Oriented Support

**Talking is helpful, but you need to DO something.**

**You want:**
- Weekly action plans
- Accountability check-ins
- Problem-solving obstacles
- Celebrating wins
- Course corrections

**Example:**  
Committed to recovery, clear on what to do (meetings, therapy, etc.), but struggle with follow-through. Coach provides accountability.

### 5. You're Building a Life, Not Just Stopping a Behavior

**Recovery isn't just "not using"—it's creating meaningful life.**

**You want:**
- Discover values, purpose, identity
- Set career/relationship/personal goals
- Build recovery capital (internal + external resources)
- Design life worth living

**Example:**  
2 years sober. No longer "fighting addiction"—now asking "What do I want to BUILD?"

## When to Use a Therapist

**Best for:**

### 1. You Have Co-Occurring Mental Health Conditions

**Depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar, etc.**

**You need:**
- Clinical diagnosis
- Evidence-based treatment
- Medication coordination (with psychiatrist)
- Insurance coverage for care

**Example:**  
Anxiety + alcohol use. Can't address one without the other. Therapist treats both.

### 2. You're Processing Trauma

**Childhood abuse, domestic violence, combat, sexual assault, etc.**

**You need:**
- Trauma-informed therapy (EMDR, CPT, PE)
- Safe space to process
- Clinical expertise in trauma healing

**Example:**  
Drinking to numb childhood sexual abuse memories. Therapist guides trauma processing work.

### 3. You're in Crisis or High Risk

**Suicidal ideation, active psychosis, severe withdrawal, etc.**

**You need:**
- Clinical assessment
- Safety planning
- Possible hospitalization coordination
- Crisis intervention

**Example:**  
Suicidal thoughts increasing. Therapist assesses safety, creates plan, coordinates higher level of care if needed.

### 4. You Need Insurance Coverage

**Can't afford out-of-pocket, need insurance to pay.**

**Therapist can:**
- Provide diagnosis for insurance
- Bill insurance directly
- Document for medical necessity

**Example:**  
Limited budget. Insurance covers therapy (after copay). Coach would be out-of-pocket.

### 5. You're Early in Recovery (Acute Phase)

**First 30-90 days, high relapse risk, unstable.**

**You need:**
- Frequent clinical support
- Relapse prevention therapy
- Coping skill development
- Connection to treatment resources

**Example:**  
Just detoxed, high relapse risk. Weekly therapy + IOP (intensive outpatient) + coach = comprehensive support.

## Why Recovery Coaches & Therapists Work BETTER Together

**Not either/or. Both/and.**

### The Complementary Model

**Therapist:**
- Weekly sessions
- Process trauma, manage mental health
- Develop coping skills
- Heal past wounds

**Recovery Coach:**
- 2x/week check-ins (or flexible)
- Implement therapy insights into daily life
- Accountability for action steps
- Build future vision

**Together:**
- Faster progress
- Better outcomes
- More comprehensive support
- Less relapse risk

### Real Example: Sarah's Recovery Journey

**Sarah, 35, alcohol use disorder + depression + childhood trauma**

**Therapist (weekly):**
- EMDR for trauma processing
- CBT for depression
- Medication coordination with psychiatrist
- Clinical treatment plan

**Recovery Coach (2x/week):**
- Accountability for sobriety (daily check-ins)
- Goal-setting (career, relationships, health)
- Navigate family boundaries (enabling mother)
- Meeting attendance support
- Life design planning

**Result:**
- 18 months sober (previous longest: 60 days)
- Depression managed (therapy + meds + lifestyle)
- Rebuilt relationship with sister
- New job aligned with values
- Sustainable recovery lifestyle

**Sarah's reflection:**  
> "Therapy healed my past. Coaching built my future. I needed both."

## Can Therapists Also Coach?

**Yes, but it's a distinct skill set.**

**Some therapists:**
- Get coach training (ICF programs)
- Offer both therapy AND coaching (separate services)
- Use coaching approach with appropriate clients

**Key distinction:**
- **Therapy client:** Clinical diagnosis, treatment plan, processing past
- **Coaching client:** No diagnosis, forward-focused, action-oriented

**Same person can switch between services:**
- Start with therapy (heal trauma, stabilize mental health)
- Graduate to coaching (build vision, set goals, take action)
- OR do both simultaneously (separate sessions)

**Example: Michael, LCSW + ICF ACC**

> "I'm a licensed therapist AND an ICF-certified coach. With therapy clients, I do trauma work, treat depression, process grief. With coaching clients, we set goals, create action plans, build accountability. Different tools, different outcomes. Both valuable."

## How to Choose: Questions to Ask Yourself

**Consider a Recovery Coach if:**
- ✅ You're stable (not in crisis)
- ✅ Mental health conditions are managed
- ✅ You want practical, action-oriented support
- ✅ You're ready to build future, not just process past
- ✅ You value frequent accountability
- ✅ You can pay out-of-pocket OR coach accepts insurance (rare)

**Consider a Therapist if:**
- ✅ You have co-occurring mental health conditions
- ✅ You're processing trauma
- ✅ You're in crisis or high risk
- ✅ You need insurance coverage
- ✅ You need clinical diagnosis/treatment
- ✅ You're early in recovery (first 90 days)

**Consider BOTH if:**
- ✅ You have complex needs (trauma + goals)
- ✅ You want comprehensive support
- ✅ Budget allows (or insurance + out-of-pocket)
- ✅ You're serious about long-term recovery

## Common Myths Debunked

**Myth 1: "Coaches are just unlicensed therapists."**  
**Reality:** Coaching is a distinct profession with its own training, ethics, and approach. Coaches don't do therapy—they do coaching.

**Myth 2: "Therapy is better because it's licensed."**  
**Reality:** Licensing ensures clinical competence. Coaching competence is measured differently (ICF credentials). Both valuable, different purposes.

**Myth 3: "I should 'graduate' from therapy to coaching."**  
**Reality:** Some people do. Others use both simultaneously. Others use therapist for clinical work, coach for life work. No hierarchy.

**Myth 4: "Coaches are cheaper but less effective."**  
**Reality:** Different tools for different jobs. Coaching is highly effective for goal-setting, accountability, action. Therapy is highly effective for trauma, mental health treatment. Cost doesn't equal quality.

**Myth 5: "I can only afford one, so I have to choose."**  
**Reality:** If budget is tight, prioritize based on needs. Crisis/trauma/mental health = therapist. Stable + want growth = coach. Ideal: both.

## The Future: Insurance Coverage for Coaching?

**Current state:** Most insurance doesn't cover coaching.

**Emerging trend:**
- Some insurance companies piloting coaching coverage
- ICF-credentialed coaches increasingly recognized
- Wellness benefits may include coaching
- Recovery coaching specifically gaining traction

**What to do now:**
- Ask your insurance if they cover recovery coaching
- Check if your employer offers wellness coaching benefits
- Consider FSA/HSA for coaching expenses (some allow it)
- Advocate for coverage (the more we ask, the more insurers will respond)
