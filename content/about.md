## Professionalizing Peer Recovery Coaching

**We're building the infrastructure for recovery coaching to become a legitimate, sustainable, credible profession.**

</div>

## The Problem We're Solving

**29.3 million adults are in recovery in the United States.**

That's a massive workforce with lived experience who understand addiction, recovery, and family dynamics from the inside.

These people can help others—often better than credentialed professionals who've never walked the path.

**But there's a problem:**

- **No standardization.** Anyone can call themselves a "recovery coach" with zero training.
- **No credentials.** Families don't know who's qualified and who's winging it.
- **No tools.** Coaches are left building practices with Google Docs and hope.
- **No pathways.** Want to make this a career? Good luck figuring out how.

**The result:** Recovery coaching remains on the fringes. Treatment centers don't hire coaches. Insurance doesn't reimburse. Families are skeptical. Coaches burn out.

**This is the "Uber moment" for recovery coaching.**

Just like ride-sharing unlocked millions of drivers, **professional training + credentials + tools can unlock millions of recovery coaches.**

---

## Our Solution: The CVR Model

### 1. ICF-Accredited Training

**International Coaching Federation (ICF) = gold standard for coaching credentials.**

- Treatment centers hire ICF coaches
- Insurance may reimburse ICF coaches
- Families trust ICF coaches
- Google searches favor ICF coaches

We built the **first ICF Level 1 accredited program specifically for family recovery coaching.**

Not generic life coaching retrofitted for recovery.  
**Built from the ground up for this field.**

### 2. Evidence-Based Methodology

**Our curriculum isn't theory. It's what works.**

We've supported hundreds of families through Core Values Recovery (our service side). **75% maintain long-term recovery** with our methodology.

That's nearly 2x the national average.

**The methodology:**
- Values-first (not problem-first)
- Identity-focused (not willpower-based)
- Infinite game philosophy (not graduation mentality)
- Family systems approach (not just individual recovery)

**This is what you'll learn. What you'll teach. What produces results.**

### 3. Complete Practice Platform

**We built the technology FIRST.**

Same Page Notes, SobaSearch, RecoveryCapital—we use these tools with our own clients. They work.

Then we made them available to CVR-trained coaches (lifetime access, included with training).

**You graduate with:**
- Certification ✅
- Credentials ✅
- Clients ✅ (from our referral network)
- Platform ✅ (professional infrastructure)
- Community ✅ (alumni network)

**Not just a certificate. A complete practice.**

## Who We Are

### Clay Johnson, PCC - Founder & Lead Instructor

<div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-coral);">

**I'm not an academic. I'm someone who's been where you are.**

My recovery journey led me to coaching. Coaching led me to building a methodology that works. That methodology led to founding Core Values Recovery.

**The stats:**
- Professional Certified Coach (PCC) through ICF
- 15+ years in recovery
- 500+ families coached
- 75% long-term success rate
- Built 4 SaaS products for recovery field

**But here's what matters more:**

I built this training because **the recovery field deserves better than generic coaching certifications.**

Families deserve coaches who understand their specific struggles.

People with lived experience deserve professional tools to turn their recovery into a career.

**This isn't just a course. It's the distillation of everything I've learned** about recovery, coaching, family dynamics, and what actually works when people are in crisis.

</div>

## Our Values

### 1. Lived Experience + Professional Training

**We believe:**
- Lived experience is valuable (essential, even)
- BUT lived experience alone isn't enough
- Professional training transforms experience into expertise
- Credentials signal competence to families who need help

**We honor both. Lived experience + professional development = excellence.**

### 2. Evidence Over Ideology

**We're pragmatic, not dogmatic.**

- If it works, we teach it
- If it doesn't, we don't care how popular it is
- 75% success rate proves methodology
- We adapt as research evolves

**No sacred cows. Just outcomes.**

### 3. Family-First Approach

**Most recovery programs focus on the individual.**

We focus on the **family system.**

**Because:**
- Addiction affects everyone (not just the identified patient)
- Family recovery = everyone heals, not just one person
- Systems approach produces better outcomes
- Families are the environment recovery happens in

**Family recovery coaching is our specialty. Our niche. Our differentiator.**

### 4. Technology as Enabler

**We built Same Page Notes because we needed it.**

Then we realized: every recovery coach needs this.

**Technology should:**
- Make coaching easier (not harder)
- Scale impact (not limit it)
- Build professionalism (not create barriers)
- Serve humans (not extract data)

**We built tools we'd want to use. Then made them available to you.**

### 5. Community Over Competition

**There are 29.3 million people in recovery.**

**There are NOT enough coaches.**

We're not competing with each other. **We're building a field together.**

**The CVR alumni network isn't transactional. It's genuine community.**

Monthly calls, peer support, referral sharing, case consultation—we succeed together.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Are you affiliated with 12-step programs?**  
A: No formal affiliation. Many of our coaches (and clients) participate in 12-step, but it's not required. We respect all paths to recovery.

**Q: Is this a religious program?**  
A: No. Our "spirituality" framework is values-based and works for atheists to evangelicals. Faith-neutral by design.

**Q: Do you only train people in recovery?**  
A: No. We train therapists, counselors, treatment staff, family members, and people in recovery. Lived experience is valuable but not required.

**Q: Why family recovery specifically?**  
A: Most programs focus on the individual. We believe family systems approach produces better outcomes. It's our specialty and differentiator.

**Q: How is this different from other recovery coach trainings?**  
A: Three things: (1) ICF-accredited, (2) Family recovery specialization, (3) Complete platform included. Most programs offer none of these.

**Q: Can I coach outside of recovery after this training?**  
A: Yes! ICF credential applies to all coaching. Family recovery is your specialty, but you can coach in other areas too.
