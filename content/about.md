## You Want to Help People in Recovery. But You Need Training That Actually Prepares You.

You have the heart for this work. Maybe you have the lived experience too. What you need now is a program that takes you seriously and gets you ready for real clients, real crises, and a real career.

</div>

***

## You Know What's at Stake

You have seen what addiction does to people. To families. To entire communities.

You have also seen what recovery makes possible.

That is why you want to coach. You want to sit across from someone in the hardest moment of their life and know exactly what to do.

But wanting to help is not enough. You have watched other coaches stumble because they got a certificate but not real training. You have seen families lose trust in coaching because someone was not prepared. You do not want to be that person.

**You want to be ready. Actually ready.**

Ready for the mother who calls you at 7 a.m. because her son did not come home. Ready for the family that has tried everything and does not believe anything will work. Ready for the client who relapses in month three and needs you to stay steady when they cannot.

That is what this program is built for.

## Why Most Coaches Aren't Ready

Here is the truth about recovery coach training right now.

**Most programs hand you a binder and wish you luck.**

You sit through lectures. You memorize scripts. You get a certificate. Then you walk into your first real session and realize none of it prepared you for what is actually happening in front of you.

**Without proper training, here is what happens:**

* You freeze in a crisis because you practiced theory, not real conversations.

* Families lose trust because you cannot demonstrate competence.

* Treatment centers will not hire you because your credential does not carry weight.

* You burn out within a year because you are doing hard work without support.

* You carry the emotional weight of this work alone, with no one to call.

This is not a failure of intention. It is a failure of preparation.

**You deserve better. Your future clients deserve better.**

## Meet Your Guide: Clay Johnson, PCC

<div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-coral);">

<p><strong>Clay knows what it feels like to want to help and not know how.</strong></p>

<p>His own recovery journey led him to coaching. But when he looked for training that matched the reality of working with individuals and families in recovery, it did not exist. So he built it.</p>

<p>His years of coaching individuals and families led him to develop the Core Values methodology. Research shows that when people in recovery engage with a long-term coach or case manager alongside treatment, their chances of sustained recovery in the first year increase to 75%.</p>

<p>He holds the Professional Certified Coach (PCC) credential through the International Coaching Federation. He built four technology products for the recovery field. He created this program because he was tired of watching good people fail at coaching due to bad training.</p>

<p><strong>Clay is not here to lecture at you. He is here to train alongside you</strong> on simulated cases, real scenarios, and the kind of conversations that textbooks cannot prepare you for.</p>

</div>

**The team behind the program:**

* Licensed therapists (LCSW, LPC, LMFT) who work in recovery daily

* ICF-credentialed coaches (PCC, ACC) with active practices

* Recovery professionals with lived experience

* Treatment center clinical directors who know what they need from coaches

**Every instructor is a practitioner. Not a theorist. They do this work every day.**

## What Makes This Program Different

### You Train the Way Doctors Train

You do not memorize scripts. You work with trainers on simulated cases, learning together. You practice difficult conversations with 50+ AI clients who respond like real clients and give you honest feedback on your technique.

When you sit down with your first real client, it will not be the first time you have navigated a crisis conversation. It will be the fiftieth.

### You Get an ICF ACC Based Credential

The International Coaching Federation is the gold standard in coaching. This is not a weekend certificate that means nothing outside your living room. Treatment centers hire coaches with ICF credentials. Families trust them. Insurance pathways are opening for them.

The Core Values Recovery Coach certification is built on the ICF ACC framework. It signals to the world that you are trained, tested, and qualified.

### You Help Individuals AND Families

Most coaching programs focus on one person at a time. This one prepares you to work with the entire family system. Because addiction does not happen in isolation. Recovery should not either.

You learn to coach the person in recovery, the spouse who is exhausted, the parents who do not know what to say, and the family that needs to find a new way to function together.

### You Learn Intervention Basics

Other programs skip this entirely. You will learn the basics of intervention techniques so you know when and how to guide families through the hardest conversation they will ever have.

### You Are Never Alone After Graduation

This is the part most programs get wrong. They train you, hand you a certificate, and disappear.

**We show up every week. For life.**

As long as you maintain your credential, you get weekly support calls and office hours. Peer consultation. Direct access to experienced coaches who have worked hundreds of cases.

Because the hardest part of coaching is not getting certified. It is the Tuesday morning when your client relapses and you need someone to talk to who understands.

***

## Imagine This Is Your Life One Year From Now

You wake up knowing exactly who you are professionally. You are a Core Values Recovery Coach with an ICF ACC based credential on your wall and real clients on your calendar.

When a family calls in crisis, you are calm. You have practiced this scenario dozens of times. You know what to say. You know what not to say. You know when to push and when to hold space.

You have tools that make you look and feel professional. Session notes, recovery assessments, meeting finders for your clients, all in one platform. You are not cobbling things together with spreadsheets and hope.

Every week, you get on a call with other coaches who are doing this same work. You share cases. You get advice. You never carry the emotional weight of this work alone.

Treatment centers refer clients to you because your credential means something. Families trust you because you can demonstrate competence, not just good intentions.

**You built a career that matters. And it sustains you while you sustain others.**

***

## What Happens If You Do Nothing

You keep wanting to help. You keep feeling called to this work.

But without proper training, you stay on the sidelines. Or worse, you start coaching without the skills you need and someone gets hurt.

Another year goes by. The families who need you do not get you. The career you want stays out of reach. The field stays unprofessional. And you stay stuck between wanting to help and knowing you are not ready.

**That does not have to be your story.**

***

## Proof That This Works

### Pilot Cohort Results

* **20 coaches certified** in the first cohort

* **90% still actively coaching** (18 out of 20)

* **157 active clients** across all coaches

* **75% first-year recovery rate** when clients pair treatment with long-term coaching

* **$84,000 combined monthly revenue** across the cohort

### Client Outcomes

* +28% average recovery capital increase

* 92% client satisfaction

* 87% report coaching was essential to their recovery

### Core Values Recovery Track Record

When people in recovery pair treatment with long-term coaching, their first-year recovery rate reaches 75%, compared to approximately 40% nationally.

**These are real numbers from real coaches with real clients. Not projections.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to be in recovery to enroll?**
No. We train people in recovery, family members, therapists, counselors, and treatment professionals. Lived experience is valuable but not required.

**What exactly is the Core Values Recovery Coach certification?**
It is an ICF ACC based coaching credential specifically designed for recovery coaching. It covers individuals and families, includes intervention basics, and prepares you for professional practice.

**How is this different from other recovery coach trainings?**
Three things. First, the ICF ACC based credential. Second, you train on simulated cases with AI clients instead of memorizing scripts. Third, you get lifetime weekly support after graduation. Most programs offer none of these.

Yes. The ICF credential applies to all coaching. Recovery is your specialty, but the skills transfer everywhere.

**Is this a religious program?**
No. The values framework works for people of all beliefs. Faith-neutral by design.

Weekly live office hours and peer consultation calls for as long as you maintain your credential. Not a Facebook group. Real support with real coaches.
