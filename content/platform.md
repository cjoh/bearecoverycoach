## You Don't Just Get Certification.  
## You Get a Complete Practice Platform.

**Most recovery coach programs give you a certificate and send you on your way. We give you the professional tools to actually run a sustainable practice.**

</div>

## The Problem With Most Coach Training

You invest $1,500-3,000 in certification.  
You learn coaching skills.  
You get a certificate.

Then what?

- **How do you manage client sessions?** (Spreadsheets? Paper notes?)
- **How do you track progress?** (Memory? Scattered documents?)
- **How do you schedule and coordinate?** (Back-and-forth emails?)
- **Where do clients find meetings?** (Google? Hope for the best?)
- **How do you assess recovery capital?** (Gut feeling? Generic questionnaires?)

**You're left building infrastructure from scratch.**  
**Or paying $50-200/month for disconnected tools that weren't built for recovery coaching.**

## Same Page Notes: Your Practice Command Center

![Same Page Notes Platform](/images/samepagenotes.png)

### What It Is:

AI-guided collaboration platform built specifically for recovery professionals. Think Notion meets Electronic Health Records, designed for coaches, not clinicians.

### What You Can Do:

**Session Documentation**
- Structured note templates for coaching sessions
- Quick capture during sessions (mobile-friendly)
- Searchable history across all clients
- HIPAA-compliant secure storage

**AI-Assisted Insights**
- Auto-generate session summaries
- Surface patterns across sessions
- Suggested talking points for next session
- Risk factor detection ("client mentioned isolation 3x this month")
- Progress highlights ("celebrate: 30 days meeting attendance")

**Client Collaboration**
- Shared workspaces with clients
- Assign homework/action items
- Share resources, articles, tools
- Family member access (with permission)
- Transparency builds trust

**Scheduling & Calendar**
- Integrated calendar
- Automated reminders (email/SMS)
- Scheduling links clients can book
- Google Calendar sync
- No more back-and-forth

**Case Coordination**
- Collaborate with other professionals (therapists, sponsors, family)
- Shared case timelines
- Permission-based access control
- All supporters literally on the same page

**Progress Tracking**
- Visual progress dashboards
- Recovery capital scores over time
- Goal tracking
- Milestone celebrations
- Data-driven coaching conversations

### Why It Matters:

**For You:**
- Spend less time on admin, more time coaching
- Look professional (clients notice)
- Never lose track of client details
- Scale beyond 5-10 clients (sustainable practice)
- Insurance-ready documentation (if you go that route)

**For Your Clients:**
- They feel organized, supported
- Can review notes/resources between sessions
- Family can see progress (with permission)
- Accountability built-in
- Technology meets them where they are

### Pricing:

**Commercial:** $500/year (what other recovery pros pay)  
**CVR-Certified Coaches:** FREE lifetime access (included with training)

## SobaSearch: Meeting Finder Integration

![SobaSearch Platform](/images/sobasearch.png)

### What It Is:

The search engine for recovery. 144,581+ meetings (AA, NA, Al-Anon, SMART, Celebrate Recovery, etc.) across all 50 states. Updated daily.

### How It Works:

**Simple Search:**
- Client enters zip code
- Gets meetings nearby
- Filters: in-person/online, day/time, meeting type
- One-click directions (Google Maps integration)

**Advanced Features:**
- "Find meetings along my commute" (home to work)
- "Show me meetings near my mom" (family support)
- Virtual meeting library (global access)
- Save favorites
- Get reminders

**Embedded in Same Page Notes:**
- You can assign meeting search homework
- "Find 3 meetings you'd actually attend"
- Client shares results with you
- Accountability loop closed

### Why It Matters:

**The #1 predictor of long-term recovery:** Ongoing peer support (meetings, community)

**The #1 friction point:** "I don't know where meetings are, when they meet, if they're welcoming..."

**SobaSearch removes the friction.**

- No more telling clients "Google AA meetings near you"
- No more outdated church basement printouts
- No more "I couldn't find a meeting that fit my schedule"
- Built into your coaching workflow

### For Your Clients:

Unlimited free access. They can search anytime, save favorites, get reminders.

## RecoveryCapital Assessment: Evidence-Based Progress Tracking

### What It Is:

Recovery capital = Internal and external resources that support recovery.

**Internal Resources:**
- Physical health
- Mental/emotional well-being
- Self-esteem, identity, sense of purpose
- Coping skills
- Spirituality/values alignment

**External Resources:**
- Social support (family, friends, recovery community)
- Housing, employment, financial stability
- Access to healthcare, therapy, recovery services
- Safe environment
- Meaningful activities

### The Assessment:

Validated questionnaire (research-backed) that measures recovery capital across multiple domains.

**Takes:** 10-15 minutes  
**Scoring:** Automatic (no manual calculation)  
**Output:** Visual dashboard showing strengths + gaps

### How You Use It:

**Intake (First Session):**
- Baseline assessment
- Identifies priorities
- Where to focus coaching energy

**Progress Tracking (Monthly or Quarterly):**
- Re-assess same domains
- See growth over time
- Celebrate wins (housing secured, new job, rebuilt relationship)
- Spot declining areas (isolation increasing, stress rising)

**Coaching Conversations:**
- Data-driven, not gut-feel
- "Your recovery capital score in social support went from 4 to 7—let's talk about what changed"
- Visual proof of progress (motivating for clients who feel stuck)

### Why It Matters:

**Traditional approach:** "How are you doing?" (vague, subjective)  
**RecoveryCapital approach:** "Let's look at your data" (specific, objective)

Clients can SEE their progress. Numbers don't lie. When someone says "I'm not getting better," you can show them: housing improved, employment improved, relationships improved. Recovery IS happening.

### Pricing:

**Commercial:** Varies by provider  
**CVR-Certified Coaches:** Unlimited client assessments (included with training)

---

- The unique challenges of family recovery
