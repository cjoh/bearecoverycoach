## You Got Certified. Now What?

**Most programs hand you a certificate and wish you luck. We hand you the tools to actually run a practice.**

</div>

***

You poured your heart into getting trained. You learned the coaching skills. You practiced. You passed the exam.

Then you sit down at your kitchen table and think:

* **Where do I keep my session notes?** Scattered Google Docs? A spiral notebook?

* **How do I coordinate with a client's therapist, sponsor, and family?** Endless email chains?

* **Where do I send someone to find a meeting tonight?** "Just Google it"?

* **How do I actually measure whether my client is getting better?** Gut feeling?

* **How do I look like a real professional?** Not someone working off a laptop and a prayer?

**This is where most recovery coaches stall out.** Not because they lack skill. Because they lack infrastructure.

Most programs give you a certificate and a handshake. Then you're on your own figuring out how to manage clients, find resources, and run a business.

***

## We Built the Solution Before We Built the Training

The Core Values Recovery Coach program was designed differently. We didn't start with curriculum. We started with the question: **What does a recovery coach actually need to succeed in the field?**

We built the technology first. Used it with hundreds of real families. Then created the training program around what actually works.

**We don't just train you and send you off. We give you the tools to run your practice from day one.**

Here's what's included with your certification -- for life:

## Coaching Simulator: Get Better by Coaching

<div style="background: var(--bg-cream); padding: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-coral); margin: 2rem 0;">

**The benefit:** Practice coaching conversations with 50+ AI personas who respond like real clients — and get feedback on your technique after every session. The best way to become a good coach is to coach.

</div>

<img src="/images/simulator.jpeg" alt="Coaching Simulator - Choose from 50+ AI personas to practice coaching" class="platform-screenshot" />

You can read every coaching book ever written. You can memorize frameworks. You can watch videos. But none of that makes you a better coach.

**Coaching makes you a better coach.**

The problem is obvious: you can't practice on real people while you're still learning. Real clients have real lives. Real consequences. You can't experiment, make mistakes, and try again without someone getting hurt.

The Coaching Simulator solves this.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)); gap: 2rem; margin: 2.5rem 0;">

<div style="background: var(--bg-cream); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #e8e4df;">

<h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--accent-coral); text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 0.1em; font-size: 0.8rem;">Practice Your Way</h4>

<h3 style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">Voice or Text Sessions</h3>

<p>Speak naturally with your AI client using real-time voice. Practice your tone, pacing, and active listening — just like a real session. Or type your responses at your own pace to carefully craft questions and reflect on your approach.</p>

</div>

<div style="background: var(--bg-cream); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #e8e4df;">

<h4 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--accent-coral); text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 0.1em; font-size: 0.8rem;">See It In Action</h4>

<h3 style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">Feedback on Every Coaching Moment</h3>

<p>After each session, your debrief pinpoints exact moments in the conversation and shows you what a stronger coaching response looks like. Scored against ICF competencies: Ethical Practice, Coaching Mindset, Trust and Safety, Active Listening, Evoking Awareness, and more.</p>

</div>

</div>

**How it works:**

* **50+ AI personas** -- Each one is a distinct person with a backstory, a personality, and real problems. A mother whose son just relapsed. A husband in denial. A teenager who doesn't want to be there. A client six months sober who's angry at everyone.

* **They push back** -- These aren't chatbots that agree with everything you say. They resist. They deflect. They shut down. They test your boundaries. They do what real clients do.

* **Practice anytime** -- No scheduling. No coordination. No guilt about taking up someone's time. Open the simulator, pick a persona, and coach. At midnight. On a Saturday. For five minutes or an hour.

**Without the Coaching Simulator:** You graduate with theory and hope your first real client goes well.

**With the Coaching Simulator:** You've already coached hundreds of sessions. Your first real client isn't practice. It's performance.

**Your price as a Core Values Recovery Coach:** 10 free sessions per year. Included for life.

## Core Values Curriculum Platform: Interactive Exercises for Your Clients

<div style="background: var(--bg-cream); padding: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-coral); margin: 2rem 0;">

**The benefit:** A digital platform where your clients complete the Core Values curriculum through guided, interactive exercises — not paper worksheets. Values identification, vision building, identity work, and more. All tracked. All shareable.

</div>

<img src="/images/Core Values.jpeg" alt="Core Values selection cards - clients identify what matters most to them" class="platform-screenshot" />

Your clients don't get a binder full of worksheets. They get a platform.

The Core Values Curriculum Platform turns every module of the coaching methodology into an interactive experience your clients complete between sessions. Values cards they select visually. Identity statements they craft and refine. Vision exercises they build over time. All of it saved, tracked, and visible to you as their coach.

**What your clients experience:**

* **Values identification** -- Beautiful, interactive cards for discovering their core values. Not a checklist. A visual, reflective exercise they'll actually want to do.

* **Identity development** -- Guided exercises where clients define who they're becoming. They write identity statements, pair them with AI-generated imagery, and revisit them as they grow.

<img src="/images/identity.jpeg" alt="Identity worksheet - clients develop their recovery identity with visual identity statements" class="platform-screenshot" />

* **Vision building** -- The Odyssey Method as an interactive experience, not a paper worksheet.

* **Awareness exercises** -- HALTCI monitoring, committee mapping, and perspective exercises built into the platform.

* **Goal setting** -- VSMART goals with built-in tracking and accountability.

**What you see as their coach:**

* Client progress across every module — who's engaged, who's stuck, who needs a nudge
* Completed exercises you can review before sessions so you show up prepared
* A shared record of their growth that makes progress visible to both of you

**Without the platform:** You email PDFs. Clients lose them. You have no idea what they've completed before a session.

**With the platform:** Clients do the work on their own time. You see what they've done. Sessions start from a place of insight, not catch-up.

**Your price as a Core Values Recovery Coach:** Included for all your clients. For life.

***

## Same Page Notes: Keep Everyone Aligned

<div style="background: var(--bg-cream); padding: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-coral); margin: 2rem 0;">

**The benefit:** Keep therapists, families, and treatment teams aligned with shared session notes. One system. One source of truth. Everyone literally on the same page.

</div>

<img src="/images/samepagenotes.jpeg" alt="Same Page Notes - Session notes, case management, and family coordination" class="platform-screenshot" />

Recovery doesn't happen in a vacuum. Your client has a therapist. A sponsor. A family who's terrified. Maybe a probation officer. Maybe a treatment team.

Right now, none of those people are talking to each other.

Same Page Notes changes that.

**What it does for your practice:**

* **Session documentation** -- Structured templates built for coaching (not therapy, not clinical notes). Mobile-friendly. Capture insights during sessions without breaking the conversation.

* **AI-assisted summaries** -- Auto-generated session recaps that surface patterns. "Client mentioned isolation three times this month." "Celebrate: 30 days of consistent meeting attendance."

* **Shared workspaces** -- Invite family members, therapists, or other supporters into a shared view. Permission-based. Transparent. Trust-building.

* **Scheduling and reminders** -- Integrated calendar, automated reminders, booking links. No more back-and-forth emails to schedule a session.

* **Progress dashboards** -- Visual tracking that shows clients (and their families) that recovery IS happening, even when it doesn't feel like it.

**Without Same Page Notes:** You're stitching together Google Docs, Calendly, and spreadsheets. You look like you're figuring it out as you go.

**With Same Page Notes:** You look established. Organized. Professional. Because you are.

**Commercial price:** $500/year.
**Your price as a Core Values Recovery Coach:** Included. For life.

## SobaSearch: Connect Clients to Meetings in Seconds

<div style="background: var(--bg-cream); padding: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-coral); margin: 2rem 0;">

**The benefit:** Help clients find recovery meetings anywhere, anytime -- 144,000+ meetings across all 50 states, searchable by location, time, and type.

</div>

<img src="/images/sobasearch.jpeg" alt="SobaSearch - Local meetings schedule with weekly calendar view" class="platform-screenshot" />

The single strongest predictor of sustained recovery? Ongoing peer support. Meetings. Community. Connection.

The single biggest friction point? "I don't know where to go."

SobaSearch removes that barrier entirely.

**How it works:**

* Client enters a zip code. Gets every meeting nearby -- AA, NA, Al-Anon, SMART Recovery, Celebrate Recovery -- filtered by day, time, and format.

* "Find meetings along my commute." "Show me meetings near my daughter's school." "What's available online tonight?"

* Integrated directly into Same Page Notes. Assign "find three meetings you'd actually attend" as homework. Client shares results. You review together. Accountability loop closed.

**No more outdated printouts. No more "just Google it." No more excuses about not finding a meeting.**

Your clients get unlimited free access. Search anytime. Save favorites. Get reminders.

***

## RecoveryCapital Assessment: Replace Gut Feeling with Data

<div style="background: var(--bg-cream); padding: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-coral); margin: 2rem 0;">

**The benefit:** Measure your client's recovery strengths and gaps with a validated assessment tool. Track progress over time with real numbers, not guesswork.

</div>

<img src="/images/report.jpeg" alt="RecoveryCapital Assessment Report - Perspective Orientation Assessment with category breakdowns" class="platform-screenshot" />

Recovery capital is everything a person has going for them in recovery -- internal resources like coping skills, self-esteem, and sense of purpose. External resources like stable housing, employment, supportive relationships, and access to care.

Most coaches assess this by asking "How are you doing?" and hoping for an honest answer.

**RecoveryCapital gives you something better: data.**

**How you use it:**

* **At intake:** Establish a baseline. See exactly where your client's strengths and gaps are. Know where to focus your energy from session one.

* **Monthly or quarterly:** Re-assess the same domains. Watch the numbers move. Celebrate the wins. Catch the warning signs early.

* **In tough conversations:** When a client says "nothing's changing," you pull up their dashboard. Housing: improved. Employment: stable. Social support: growing. Recovery IS happening. Now they can see it.

**Traditional approach:** "How are you doing?" (vague, subjective, easy to deflect)
**RecoveryCapital approach:** "Let's look at your numbers." (specific, objective, motivating)

**Your price as a Core Values Recovery Coach:** Unlimited client assessments. Included. For life.

***

## Alumni Network: You'll Never Practice Alone

<div style="background: var(--bg-cream); padding: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-coral); margin: 2rem 0;">

**The benefit:** Weekly support and office hours for life. A professional community that has your back long after training ends.

</div>

Therapists have required clinical supervision. Social workers have team meetings. Doctors have grand rounds.

Recovery coaches? Most work completely alone.

Not Core Values coaches.

**What you get -- for life (as long as you maintain your credential):**

* **Weekly support calls and office hours** -- Bring your hardest cases. Get real-time guidance from experienced coaches and trainers. Every week. Not monthly. Not quarterly. Weekly.

* **Private community** -- Ask questions. Share resources. Celebrate wins. Process the hard stuff. You're surrounded by people who understand this work.

* **Job board and referral network** -- Coaching opportunities posted by treatment centers, therapists, and families looking for help. Client overflow sharing. Referral partnerships.

* **Continuing education** -- Guest experts. Advanced training modules. ICF CCE hours toward your PCC credential. You keep growing.

**This isn't an alumni Facebook group that goes quiet after three months. This is an active, supported professional community.**

***

## What Happens Without These Tools

Let's be honest about what the alternative looks like.

You graduate from a typical certification program. You've got knowledge. You've got a certificate. You've got enthusiasm.

And then:

* You spend weeks researching which scheduling tool to use, which note-taking app, which assessment to try

* You cobble together five or six generic SaaS products that don't talk to each other

* You spend $100+/month on tools that weren't built for recovery coaching

* You look like you're "just starting out" to every potential client and referral partner

* You handle a difficult case alone at 10pm and have nobody to call

* You wonder if you're even doing this right

**That's the path most recovery coaches walk. And it's why so many burn out or give up within the first year.**

***

## What Happens With These Tools

You graduate from the Core Values Recovery Coach program. You've got knowledge AND infrastructure.

Day one:

* Your Same Page Notes account is already set up and customized. You've been using it throughout training.

* Your first real client gets an intake assessment, a shared workspace, and a meeting search -- all in their first session.

* Their therapist gets invited into the shared notes. The family gets a view into progress. Everyone's aligned.

* You pull up RecoveryCapital data in your second session and build a coaching plan from actual evidence.

* When you hit a tough case, you bring it to the weekly support call and get guidance from coaches who've been there.

**You'll launch your practice with professional tools that make you look established from day one.**

Not because you're pretending. Because you're prepared.

## Security and Compliance

Your clients trust you with sensitive information. We take that seriously.

* **HIPAA-compliant** infrastructure

* **256-bit encryption** in transit and at rest

* **Daily backups** -- your data is protected

* **Two-factor authentication** on every account

* **Clients own their data** -- export anytime, no lock-in, no data selling

You can confidently tell every client: "Your information is secure, private, and protected."

***

## Platform Training Is Built Into the Curriculum

You don't get a login and a help article. You learn every tool as part of your training.

* **Weeks 1-2:** Account setup, template customization, first practice client

* **Weeks 5-6:** Live session documentation with AI summaries

* **Week 10:** RecoveryCapital assessment -- administer, interpret, and build coaching plans from data

* **Week 15:** Client collaboration, family access, and care team coordination

* **Weeks 18-20:** Business setup -- pricing, invoicing, referral partnerships

By graduation, you're not learning the tools. You've already been using them for months.
