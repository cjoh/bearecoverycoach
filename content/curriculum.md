## Recovery Coaching Is Bigger Than One Skill

Helping someone get into recovery is one thing. Helping them stay there — for years, through relapses, through family crises, through the slow Tuesday afternoons when nothing dramatic is happening but everything is fragile — that requires a different kind of coach.

It requires someone who can coach. Who understands case management. Who knows when intervention is the right call. Who can work with a family, not just an individual. Who has the tools to track progress and the business sense to sustain a practice.

**That's what we train.** Not specialists in one framework. Well-rounded coaches who can meet their clients wherever they are — and walk with them for the long haul.

We teach coaching, intervention, and case management through a single lens: what does your client need right now to move toward lasting recovery? Sometimes that's a powerful question. Sometimes that's a referral to treatment. Sometimes that's sitting with a family who doesn't know what to do next.

**You'll be ready for all of it.**

## Built by Coaches, for Coaches

This curriculum was designed by practitioners who coach individuals and families in recovery every day. They asked one question: **What does a coach actually need to know and be able to do on day one?**

The answer is eight training areas. Each one fills a gap that other programs leave wide open. Together, they give you the most complete foundation in recovery coaching available anywhere.

This is a rigorous professional certification. Real standards and a real credential when you finish.

***

## The 8 Training Areas

**Format:** 20 weeks, blended learning
**Live Instruction:** 48 hours (Zoom, 2–3 hours/week)
**Independent Study:** 32 hours (reading, exercises, practice coaching)
**Mentor Coaching:** 10 hours included
**Cohort Size:** Max 30 coaches

## 1. The Essentials of Coaching

Before you learn recovery coaching, you learn coaching. What it is. What it isn't. Where the lines are between coaching, therapy, sponsorship, and case management.

**What you'll learn:**

* The professional definition of coaching and its core competencies
* How to structure a coaching session from opening to close
* Active listening, powerful questions, and evoking awareness
* The coaching agreement — how to establish expectations and create safety from session one
* Scope of practice: when to coach and when to refer
* Ethics and boundaries specific to recovery coaching
* The difference between coaching and advising (and why it matters more than you think)

**Why this comes first:** Everything else builds on this. If you don't understand what coaching actually is, you'll default to giving advice, rescuing, or doing therapy without a license. This training area prevents that.

***

## 2. The Essentials of Recovery and Case Management

Recovery coaching doesn't happen in a vacuum. Your clients are navigating treatment systems, support groups, medication, housing, employment, and a dozen other moving pieces. You need to understand the landscape.

**What you'll learn:**

* The continuum of care: detox, residential, PHP, IOP, outpatient, sober living, aftercare
* How to assess where a client is and what level of support they need
* Recovery Capital assessment using the POA tool — measuring where your client actually is, not where they say they are
* Case management fundamentals: connecting clients to resources, coordinating with treatment teams, tracking progress
* The role of 12-step programs, SMART Recovery, and other mutual aid
* When coaching is appropriate and when your client needs a different level of care

**Why this matters:** A recovery coach who doesn't understand the treatment system can't navigate it for their clients. You'll know the landscape cold.

***

## 3. The 5 Models of Intervention

Most coaching programs skip intervention entirely. You won't.

**What you'll learn:**

* The five distinct intervention models and when each one is appropriate
* How to assess whether intervention is the right step for a family
* How to prepare a family for the intervention conversation
* How to facilitate the conversation without breaking trust
* How to provide post-intervention coaching support for individuals and families
* Working with professional interventionists: when to lead, when to support, when to refer

**Why this matters:** Families in crisis will come to you. They'll ask, "What do we do?" You need an answer that goes beyond "find a therapist." Understanding intervention gives you tools for the hardest conversations families will ever have.

***

## 4. Family Coaching

Addiction doesn't happen in isolation. Recovery shouldn't either.

Most coaching programs focus on one person at a time. This training prepares you to work with the entire family system.

**What you'll learn:**

* How addiction affects every member of a family — not just the person using
* Coaching the spouse who is exhausted, the parents who don't know what to say, the siblings who've been forgotten
* How to support a family without taking sides
* Setting boundaries without giving advice
* Holding space for pain without trying to fix it
* The dynamics of enabling, codependency, and healthy support — and how to help families tell the difference
* How to coach the person in recovery AND their family, together and separately

**Why this matters:** The families who need you most are the ones no one else is trained to help. This is where you make the biggest difference.

***

## 5. The Core Values Curriculum

This is the coaching methodology you'll use with your clients. It's values-driven, identity-focused, and built for recovery.

**What you'll learn to facilitate:**

* **Values identification** — helping clients discover what actually matters to them, not what they think should matter
* **Vision creation** — the Odyssey Method for helping clients imagine a future worth fighting for
* **Awareness building** — teaching clients to observe their own patterns instead of being controlled by them
* **Acceptance** — the difference between accepting reality and giving up
* **Internal voices** — helping clients manage the committee in their head, including the Voice of Addiction
* **Blocks and breakthroughs** — identifying limiting beliefs, interpretations, and assumptions that keep clients stuck
* **Values-aligned goals** — mastery goals that sustain people for life, not performance goals that burn them out
* **Identity change** — becoming the person who doesn't need to be fixed

**Why this matters:** This is the methodology that drives your coaching practice. You don't just learn it. You practice it — with AI clients, with trainers, and with peers — until it's second nature.

***

## 6. The Core Values Technology Suite

You graduate with professional tools, not just a certificate.

**What you'll get trained on:**

* **Same Page Notes** — AI-guided collaboration platform for documenting sessions, surfacing insights, and coordinating with families and treatment teams
* **SobaSearch** — access to 144,000+ recovery meetings nationwide so you can connect clients to the right meeting, the right group, the right fit
* **Recovery Capital Assessment** — evidence-based tool for tracking client progress with validated metrics, so you can show families and referral sources that the work is working
* **Alumni Network and Job Board** — peer consultation, continuing education, and referral networks

**Why this matters:** Most coaches graduate and cobble together spreadsheets, Google Docs, and hope. You graduate with a platform that makes you look and operate as professionally as you are.

***

## 7. Business Fundamentals

A coaching credential without a business plan is an expensive hobby.

**What you'll learn:**

* How to price your services and structure your packages
* Positioning and marketing for recovery coaches
* Building referral networks with treatment centers, therapists, and other professionals
* Client intake systems and professional documentation
* The basics of running a coaching practice: scheduling, billing, boundaries
* Your coaching bio, intake documents, and professional presence

**Why this matters:** You're not just becoming a coach. You're building a career. This training area makes sure you can actually sustain it.

***

## 8. Advanced Coaching with AI

This is the feature no other program offers.

**What you'll practice with:**

* **50+ AI clients** built on real client scenarios — they resist, deflect, cry, get angry, and test your boundaries the way real clients do
* AI clients who give you real-time feedback on your coaching technique — not a grade on a multiple choice test
* Crisis scenarios, family conflicts, relapse situations, and intervention conversations
* A client in active denial who insists everything is fine
* A family member who wants you to fix their loved one
* A client who fires back with "you don't understand my situation"

**You work with trainers on simulated cases, learning together.** It's not rote scripts. It's real-time problem solving with experienced coaches guiding you through scenarios that would take years to encounter organically.

**Why this matters:** By the time you sit with your first real client, you've already been there. Hundreds of times. Your first real session isn't your first rodeo. It's your hundredth.
