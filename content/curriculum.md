## Module 1: Getting Started

**Duration:** Week 1-2 | 8 hours  
**Focus:** Foundations, safety, and recovery focus identification

### What You'll Learn:

**The Recovery Coaching Framework**
- Recovery coaching vs therapy vs sponsorship vs case management
- Scope of practice and ethical boundaries
- When to refer (substance use disorder, mental health crisis, medical issues)
- Professional liability and insurance considerations

**Identify Your Focus**
- Recovery isn't just substances: relationships, anger, grief, dishonesty, avoidance, caretaking
- Why focus matters: one thing at a time, deep vs surface work
- How to help clients choose their recovery focus
- Family recovery vs individual recovery (the CVR distinction)

**The Commitment Triangle**
- Coach commitments: Confidentiality, no judgment, honesty
- Client commitments: Honesty, willingness, open-mindedness
- Creating psychological safety for vulnerable conversations
- How mutual commitments build trust and enable change

**ICF Core Competencies Introduced:**
- Establishes and Maintains Agreements

---

## Module 2: Core Values

**Duration:** Week 3-4 | 10 hours  
**Focus:** Values as foundation for all recovery work

### What You'll Learn:

**Pragmatic Spirituality**
- Living in alignment with core values = spirituality (universal definition)
- Works for atheist to evangelical—no religious requirement
- Why values-first (not problem-first) creates sustainable change
- The alternative to "fixing what's broken"

**The Core Insight**
- Almost every choice = moving toward values OR away from discomfort
- Choosing comfort over values → lose confidence, energy, resilience, connection
- The compound effect of small value-aligned choices
- How addiction/avoidance patterns form when we choose comfort

**Values vs Outcomes**
- Values = internal (you control): honesty, courage, compassion, growth
- Outcomes = external (you don't control): staying sober, saving marriage, getting job
- Commitment to values = staying steady regardless of outcomes
- The infinite game: playing to keep playing, not to "win"

**The Values Pyramid**
- Spiritual/Core Values (top) → Mental/Emotional → Physical → Relationships (bottom)
- Small movements at top create massive changes at bottom
- Why traditional treatment starts at bottom (relationships, substance use) and fails
- The CVR approach: start with values, let behavior follow

**The Infinite Game Philosophy**
- Finite games: Set rules, limited time, clear winner/loser (e.g., "90 days sober = success")
- Infinite games: Bound by values, rules evolve, objective = prolong play indefinitely
- Recovery as infinite game = commitment to ongoing growth
- How this reframes relapse, setbacks, and "progress"
- The three ways we play: Building awareness, taking responsibility, committing to ourselves

**Coaching Application:**
- Values identification exercises (not just worksheets—deep inquiry)
- Circling ALL values that resonate → top 10 → top 5 core values
- Values hierarchy: which values take priority when they conflict?
- Spotting value-outcome confusion in client language
- Powerful questions that surface values

**ICF Core Competencies:**
- Evokes Awareness
- Facilitates Client Growth

### Deliverables:
- Personal top 5 core values (your own inner work)
- Values exploration conversation guide
- Client values worksheet

---

## Module 3: Vision

**Duration:** Week 5-6 | 8 hours  
**Focus:** Breaking free from past constraints through forward-looking visions

### What You'll Learn:

**The Problem: Inward Fixation**
- Recovery can make us obsessed with the past, trauma, what's wrong
- True recovery = discovering and moving toward forward purpose
- Why "not using" isn't a vision—it's the absence of a problem
- The shift from "escaping pain" to "pursuing meaning"

**The Cone of Constraints**
- Past trauma creates invisible limits on future possibilities
- We unconsciously replay old patterns because we can't imagine alternatives
- How family systems, addiction, codependency narrow what seems possible
- Vision-setting as constraint-breaking

**The Odyssey Method (3 Visions)**

**Vision 1: Current Path**
- Life in 5 years if you continue as you are
- Honest assessment of trajectory
- Forces confrontation with reality (not fantasy or fear)

**Vision 2: Alternate Path**
- Quit your career, can't reapply, completely different path
- "If I couldn't do what I do now, what would I do?"
- Uncovers hidden interests, suppressed desires
- Challenges identity attachment ("I'm a therapist/teacher/etc.")

**Vision 3: Radical Path**
- No fear of judgment, money no object, social obligations irrelevant
- Pure desire without constraint
- "If I could do ANYTHING..."
- Reveals what we truly want vs what we think we should want

**Why 3 Visions Matter:**
- Broadens perspective beyond binary thinking
- Uncovers hidden constraints, blocks, limiting beliefs
- Reveals assumptions we didn't know we were making
- Creates permission to want different things
- Identifies patterns across visions (what shows up in all 3?)

**Coaching Application:**
- Facilitating Odyssey planning sessions
- Spotting resistance, fear, "can't" language
- Navigating emotional responses to radical vision
- Helping clients reconcile visions with current reality
- When to push, when to hold space

**ICF Core Competencies:**
- Evokes Awareness
- Facilitates Client Growth

### Deliverables:
- Your own 3 Odyssey visions (personal work)
- Odyssey facilitation guide
- Vision integration worksheet

---

## Module 4: Awareness

**Duration:** Week 7-9 | 10 hours  
**Focus:** How the brain works, self-awareness, stress response recognition

### What You'll Learn:

**The Brain as Law Firm (Metaphor)**

**Junior Partner (Neocortex):**
- Big-picture thinking, creativity, communication, problem-solving, strategy
- Great at complex decisions, long-term planning, empathy
- Needs calm, safety, energy to function well
- When offline: can't think clearly, make good choices, regulate emotions

**Senior Partner (Midbrain):**
- Raw instincts, survival, perceiving threats, fight-flight-freeze
- Great at keeping you alive in actual danger
- Terrible at everything else: relationships, decisions, nuance
- Takes control when threat detected (real or imagined)

**The Crisis Mode:**
- Senior Partner hijacks the firm
- Tunnel vision, obsessive focus, hasty decisions, emotional reactivity
- Short-term: can be effective (actual danger)
- Long-term: burnout, poor decisions, inflammation, disease, relapse
- Addiction/codependency as chronic crisis mode

**The Board of Directors (Awareness):**
- Observes both partners
- Can't prevent Senior from seizing control
- CAN notice when it's happening
- With practice: catch stress response earlier, help partners work together
- This is the practice of recovery coaching

**Three Levels of Awareness**

**1. Self-Awareness**
- **Physical:** HALTCI (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired, Craving, Intoxicated)
- **Emotional:** Naming feelings accurately, intensity awareness
- **Intellectual:** Thought patterns, cognitive distortions, stories we tell
- **Spiritual:** Alignment with values, sense of purpose/meaning/connection

**2. Awareness of Reality**
- How perceptions shape stress experience
- Separating facts from interpretation
- Recognizing what you can/can't control
- The gap between "what is" and "what I think should be"
- Acceptance as awareness of reality without resistance

**3. Awareness of Possibility**
- Imagining what could be (distinct from vision—smaller scale)
- Opens solutions, opportunities, ways forward
- Reframing problems as possibilities
- The coaching stance: "What else is possible here?"

**The Six Perspectives Exercise**
- Viewing same struggle through 6 lenses:
  1. Apathy/Victimhood ("This is hopeless")
  2. Rage/Anger ("This is unfair!")
  3. Forgiveness ("I release resentment")
  4. Compassion ("I understand why this happened")
  5. Reconciliation/Acceptance ("This is what is")
  6. Creativity/Passion ("What can I create from this?")
- Each perspective offers different insights
- Movement through perspectives as growth
- Coaching clients through perspective shifts

**Coaching Application:**
- Teaching HALTCI self-monitoring
- Spotting "Senior Partner" language in sessions
- Powerful questions that build awareness
- When clients are in crisis mode: how to coach (or not coach)
- Building the "observer" muscle through practice

**ICF Core Competencies:**
- Evokes Awareness
- Maintains Presence
- Listens Actively

### Deliverables:
- HALTCI self-monitoring log (2 weeks)
- Six Perspectives coaching guide
- Crisis mode recognition checklist

---

## Module 5: Acceptance

**Duration:** Week 10-11 | 8 hours  
**Focus:** Accepting reality without denial, resistance, or avoidance

### What You'll Learn:

**The Core Principle**
*"There is only one cause to be frustrated: whenever we are upset, no matter what the story is, it is because we cannot accept the universe as it is."*

**The Suffering Formula**
- Pain × Resistance = Suffering
- Pain is inevitable (part of life)
- Resistance is optional (our response)
- Denial = resistance to state of universe
- Acceptance = acknowledging truth as it is

**Acceptance vs Acquiescence**
- Acceptance ≠ approval, agreement, or giving up
- Acceptance = recognizing truth without denial
- You can accept abuse exists AND work to stop it
- You can accept addiction is a disease AND hold people accountable
- The paradox: acceptance enables change (resistance blocks it)

**Common Forms of Denial**
- **Procrastination:** "I'll deal with it later"
- **Dread:** "I can't handle what's coming"
- **Victim-stance:** "This is happening TO me"
- **Minimization:** "It's not that bad"
- **Rationalization/Justification:** "I had good reasons"
- **Selective memory:** Forgetting evidence that contradicts our story
- **Substance abuse/emotional numbing:** Avoiding reality through escape

**Spheres of Control (3 Concentric Circles)**

**Inner Circle - CONTROL:**
- Your thoughts, actions, responses
- "You're the skipper—can't command waves/wind, but steering is all you"
- The ONLY place you have full control
- Coaching focus: what's in YOUR control?

**Middle Circle - INFLUENCE:**
- Like a garden: plant seeds, tend them, but can't control every aspect
- Relationships, job performance, health (to some degree)
- You can influence outcomes but not guarantee them
- Letting go of attachment to specific outcomes

**Outer Circle - BEYOND YOUR REACH:**
- Weather, global events, others' decisions, time passing
- Like a theater audience: watch, react, but story isn't yours to rewrite
- Radical acceptance required
- Serenity prayer territory

**Expectations**
- Expectations = attachment to an outcome that's acceptable to us
- Expectations = premeditated resentment
- Letting go ≠ lowering standards
- Letting go = detaching from specific outcomes
- Commitment to values (control) vs attachment to outcomes (influence/no control)

**The 1% Responsibility**
- Even if 99% is out of your hands, there's 1% where you're in driver's seat
- Finding your 1% = finding some control
- Coaching focuses on the 1%, not the 99%
- Empowering vs victimizing

**Theory of Completeness vs Theory of Brokenness**

**Theory of Brokenness (Harmful):**
- Culture tells us we're constantly in need of repair
- "Fix yourself, improve yourself, you're not enough yet"
- Can't stay loyal to values when viewing self as inadequate
- Shame-based, deficit-focused
- Perpetuates unworthiness

**Theory of Completeness (Empowering):**
- **You are not broken. You are perfect.**
- Accept yourself INCLUDING flaws
- Perfect like a story: ups, downs, conflicts make it complete
- Self-improvement stems from love and respect, not lack
- Growth as expansion, not fixing

**Coaching Application:**
- Spotting denial patterns in client language
- Powerful questions that surface resistance
- Guiding Spheres of Control exercise
- Navigating client attachment to outcomes
- Holding Theory of Completeness when client can't
- When acceptance looks like giving up (how to discern)

**ICF Core Competencies:**
- Evokes Awareness
- Facilitates Client Growth

### Deliverables:
- Personal Spheres of Control map
- Denial pattern recognition guide
- Acceptance vs acquiescence coaching framework

## Module 6: Committee Thinking

**Duration:** Week 12-13 | 8 hours  
**Focus:** Organizing thoughts, understanding intent, creating distance from negative self-talk

### What You'll Learn:

**The Core Truth**
*"You are not your thoughts."*

**Proof:**
- You were you before you could talk
- You made that voice say "hello" (you're separate from it)
- You're the one who heard it (observer, not the voice)
- Thoughts arise; you don't fully control them

**The Key Insight**
- Thoughts aren't entirely in our control
- Influenced by: physiology, biology, environment, hormones, blood sugar, sleep, stress
- You don't GET TO CHOOSE your thoughts
- You GET TO CHOOSE which ones you tune into
- Like radio: voices exist, you control the dial

**Metaphor Shift: Committee of Voices**
- Not "my thoughts" → "the committee"
- You're the chair of the board (receiver, not generator)
- Multiple voices with different agendas
- Your job: listen, discern, decide

**Discovering Your Committee**
- Identify thinking patterns
- Give each a name/character
- Recognize their "voice" and intent
- Examples:
  - **The Justifier:** Makes excuses, rationalizes
  - **The Critic:** Never satisfied, finds flaws
  - **Voice of Addiction:** "Just one won't hurt"
  - **Voice of Depression:** "Nothing matters, why try"
  - **The Bellhop:** "Yes sir, whatever you need" (people-pleasing)
  - **The Prosecutor:** Blames, accuses, finds fault in others
  - **The Cheerleader:** Encourages, motivates, believes in you
  - **Voice of Kindness:** Compassionate, gentle, understanding
  - **The Impostor Voice:** "You're a fraud, they'll find out"

**Where Committee Members Come From**

**1. Evolutionary:**
- We evolved to have them (survival advantage)
- Negativity bias (hyper-vigilance kept ancestors alive)
- Social comparison (hierarchy monitoring)
- These voices served a purpose once

**2. Protective:**
- We needed them at some point to protect us
- Child needed Justifier to avoid punishment
- Critic kept us from being blindsided
- They stuck around even when no longer needed
- Outdated software running on new hardware

**Managing Your Committee (5-Step Process)**

**1. RECOGNIZE the voice**
- "Oh, that's the Critic"
- Put distance on it (not "I'm worthless" → "The Critic says I'm worthless")
- Name it, claim it, defuse it

**2. HEAR what it has to say**
- Don't interrupt, suppress, or argue
- Let it speak fully
- Curiosity, not combat

**3. UNDERSTAND intent of message**
- What is this voice trying to protect me from?
- What value does it advocate for?
- What fear is underneath?
- The Critic might advocate for excellence (twisted way)

**4. ACT on it if necessary**
- Is there wisdom here?
- Is action required?
- Thank the voice, take what's useful, leave the rest

**5. MOVE ON to next speaker**
- Don't get stuck in filibuster
- Acknowledge, assess, advance
- Chair controls the agenda

**The Buddhism Formula**
- Pain × Resistance = Suffering
- "What you resist, persists"
- To move past filibustering members: stop resisting
- Give full attention → accept what it has to say → find value it advocates for
- Then it quiets down

**The Voice of Addiction (Special Case)**

**Why It's Different:**
- Insidious and nefarious
- Whispers to EVERY other committee member
- **NOT an honest actor**
- Forces you to seek comfort at expense of values
- Without substance: uncomfortable and will seek at any cost

**How to Handle:**
- **This voice is your opponent**
- Cannot rationalize with enemy
- Can recognize enemy trying to destroy you
- Don't debate, just recognize and dismiss
- "That's the Voice of Addiction. Not listening."

**Your Prime (New Member)**

**What It Is:**
- Imagined embodiment of your core values
- Member you can ALWAYS turn to
- Knows intuitively what's right for you
- Compassionate, doesn't expect perfection
- Voice of wisdom, not shame

**The Catch:**
- Your prime is humble
- Doesn't speak until called upon
- Unlike other voices (loud, demanding), you have to GO TO your prime and ask
- Requires intentional inquiry
- "What would my prime say about this?"

**Coaching Application:**
- Helping clients identify their committee members
- Teaching 5-step process
- Spotting Voice of Addiction in session
- Introducing concept of "Your Prime"
- Powerful questions: "Which voice is that?" "What does your prime say?"
- Committee mapping exercise

**ICF Core Competencies:**
- Evokes Awareness
- Facilitates Client Growth

### Deliverables:
- Personal committee map (your voices)
- Committee coaching conversation guide
- "Your Prime" exploration worksheet

## Module 7: Blocks

**Duration:** Week 14-15 | 8 hours  
**Focus:** Identifying and releasing limiting beliefs, assumptions, interpretations

### What You'll Learn:

**Five Options for Moving Forward**

When blocked by relationship with someone/something, you have FIVE options:
1. **Remain blocked by it** (status quo)
2. **Leave it** (exit the situation)
3. **Accept it** (stop resisting reality)
4. **Change your perspective of it** (reframe)
5. **Change it** (take action to alter the situation)

**To our knowledge, these are the ONLY five options.**

Usually we default to #1 (remain blocked) until options 2-5 become less painful than staying stuck.

**Three Types of Blocks (iPEC Model)**

### 1. Limiting Beliefs

**What They Are:**
- Beliefs about people, places, things IN GENERAL
- Limit potential and growth
- Often inherited (parents, culture, religion, society)
- Feel like "truth" but are actually interpretations

**Examples:**
- "Money is the root of all evil"
- "People don't change"
- "You need a college degree to be successful"
- "Showing emotion is weakness"
- "Family always comes first"
- "If I'm not busy, I'm lazy"
- "Conflict is bad and should be avoided"
- "There's a right way and a wrong way"

**Coaching Focus:**
- Surfacing unconscious beliefs
- Challenging origin ("Where did you learn that?")
- Testing validity ("Is that always true?")
- Exploring cost ("What does this belief cost you?")

### 2. Interpretations

**What They Are:**
- How you CHOOSE to experience an event
- The story you make up about what happened
- More personal than limiting beliefs
- Often automatic, unconscious

**Examples:**
- Spouse is quiet → "They're angry at me" (reality: they have indigestion)
- Boss didn't say hello → "I'm getting fired" (reality: they were distracted)
- Friend cancelled plans → "They don't value our friendship" (reality: they're overwhelmed)
- Client relapsed → "I'm a bad coach" (reality: client made a choice)

**The Victim Stance:**
- Special type of interpretation
- "Things happen TO me" vs "I participate in creating my life"
- Powerless, helpless, at mercy of circumstances
- Incompatible with recovery (requires agency)

**Coaching Focus:**
- Fact vs interpretation separation
- "What's the story you're telling yourself?"
- Alternative interpretations exercise
- Spotting victim language
- Reframing without dismissing feelings

### 3. Assumptions

**What They Are:**
- Based on belief that past events will inevitably repeat in future
- More personal than limiting beliefs
- Involve PREDICTION
- Often unconscious

**Examples:**
- "If I speak up, I'll be rejected" (happened before)
- "Relationships always end badly for me"
- "I can't trust people in authority"
- "If I try, I'll fail"
- "Success requires sacrificing family"
- "Recovery means giving up fun"

**Three Things Happen When We Assume:**

**1. We prove our own point**
- Self-fulfilling prophecy
- Behave in ways that create the outcome we fear
- "See? I knew it would happen"

**2. We refuse to act**
- Paralysis, avoidance
- "Why try? It'll just fail anyway"
- Opportunities missed

**3. We develop blindspots**
- Can't see evidence that contradicts assumption
- Confirmation bias
- Miss positive signals

**Why Assumptions Serve Us:**
- Experience = compounding years of assumptions toward success
- Don't touch hot stove (got burned last time)
- Assumptions as pattern recognition
- The problem: when patterns from past don't apply to present

**Challenging Assumptions:**

**1. Seek outside perspectives**
- Sponsors, coaches, trusted friends
- "What do you see that I'm missing?"
- Fresh eyes on old patterns

**2. Test by experimenting**
- Small, safe experiments
- "What if I tried X and it didn't go badly?"
- Gather new data

**3. Change the story**
- Rewrite the narrative
- "What if it could be different this time?"
- Permission to have a different outcome

**Coaching Application:**
- Blocks identification exercises
- Powerful questions for each type
- Distinguishing beliefs vs interpretations vs assumptions
- Challenging without invalidating
- Exploring the five options
- When to push, when to hold

**ICF Core Competencies:**
- Evokes Awareness
- Facilitates Client Growth

### Deliverables:
- Personal blocks inventory (your own work)
- Blocks identification framework
- Five options coaching guide

## Module 8: Goals

**Duration:** Week 16-17 | 10 hours  
**Focus:** Creating values-aligned mastery goals and building systems for achievement

### What You'll Learn:

**Core Philosophy**
*"When goals resonate with core values, they become more than to-do items—they transform into sources of energy and motivation, guiding toward true fulfillment."*

**Metaphor: Goals as Seeds**
- Planted in soil of values → grow robustly
- Without values → wither, feel forced, unsustainable
- You can achieve goals without values alignment (short-term)
- But you'll feel empty, exhausted, "is this it?"

**Three Types of Goals**

### 1. Fear/Resentment Goals

**What They Are:**
- Based on past resentment or future worry
- Motivated by avoiding pain
- "I never want to feel that way again"

**Examples:**
- "Lose weight because I hate how I look"
- "Make money because I was poor growing up"
- "Get sober because I'm ashamed"

**Why They Work Short-Term:**
- Fear is powerful motivator
- Crisis creates urgency
- Initial momentum is strong

**Why They Fail Long-Term:**
- Shame-based
- When fear subsides, motivation disappears
- Can't maintain negative motivation forever
- Achieve goal, still feel empty

### 2. Performance Goals

**What They Are:**
- Tied to specific outcome in future
- Usually measurable
- External validation

**Examples:**
- "Lose 50 pounds"
- "Make $100K this year"
- "Get promoted to manager"
- "Complete 100 coaching hours"

**Why They're Problematic:**
- Finite-game mentality (win or lose)
- You don't fully control outcomes
- Achievement brings temporary satisfaction
- "What now?" when you hit the goal
- Failure feels devastating

**When They're Useful:**
- Milestones within larger mastery goals
- Tracking progress
- Celebrating wins
- But NOT the primary goal

### 3. Mastery Goals (OPTIMAL)

**What They Are:**
- Not tied to outcome
- Tied to GROWTH
- Process-oriented, not result-oriented
- Infinite game approach

**Examples:**
- "Increase physical fitness" (not "lose 50 lbs")
- "Grow as a ukulele player" (not "perform concert")
- "Deepen my coaching skills" (not "get 10 clients")
- "Strengthen family relationships" (not "fix my marriage")

**Why They Work:**
- Commitment to values vs attachment to outcome
- Can look at ANY outcome (even negative) and find growth
- Sustainable long-term
- Every step is progress (no failure, only learning)
- Energy-giving, not energy-draining

**The Shift:**
- Performance: "Did I hit the target?"
- Mastery: "Did I grow?"

**VSMART Goals Framework**

**V - Values Linked:**
- Explicitly connected to one of your core values
- Why does this matter to you?
- How does achieving this align with who you want to be?

**S - Specific:**
- Clear and precise
- Not vague ("be healthier" → "practice yoga 3x/week")

**M - Measurable:**
- Can track progress
- Know when you're moving forward
- Doesn't have to be numeric (qualitative measures work)

**A - Achievable:**
- Challenging but possible
- Stretch, not break
- Within your control/influence

**R - Relevant:**
- Should matter to you (not someone else's goal)
- Fits bigger life plans
- Aligned with current season of life

**T - Time-bound:**
- Set a deadline (even if mastery is ongoing)
- Creates healthy urgency
- 12-month planning horizon

**Systems: Building Structure**

**What Systems Are:**
- Habits, supports, resources, commitments to reach goal
- The "how" behind the "what"
- Dynamic, not static (change over time)

**Examples:**
- **Goal:** Grow as a coach
- **Systems:** Weekly supervision, monthly training, daily reflection, peer consultation, reading 1 book/month, practice coaching 5 hours/week

**The Question:**
- Are we PURPOSEFULLY building systems?
- Or are systems forming in reaction to circumstance?
- Intentional design vs default drift

**Types of Support Systems:**
- **Accountability:** Coaches, sponsors, friends who check in
- **Education:** Books, courses, trainings, mentors
- **Practice:** Reps, experiments, safe failure environments
- **Resources:** Time, money, tools, space
- **Community:** Peers, cohorts, masterminds
- **Rituals:** Morning routine, weekly review, annual planning

**Coaching Application:**
- Helping clients distinguish goal types
- Converting performance goals to mastery goals
- VSMART goal-setting process
- Systems design conversation
- Accountability structures
- Tracking progress without attachment to outcomes

**ICF Core Competencies:**
- Facilitates Client Growth
- Establishes and Maintains Agreements

### Deliverables:
- Personal 12-month VSMART goals (your practice)
- Goal types assessment tool
- Systems design template

---

## Module 9: Habits

**Duration:** Week 18-20 | 10 hours  
**Focus:** Identity-based habit change (not willpower)

### What You'll Learn:

**The Traditional Habit Theory (That Fails)**

**What We're Usually Taught:**
- Make it easy (reduce friction)
- Track success (streak apps)
- Build momentum (21 days to form habit)
- Reward yourself
- Use willpower

**The Problem:**
- When you fail (and you will), guilt + shame flood in
- Identity shift: "I'm not a flosser. I never change."
- Flossing becomes CONTRARY to identity
- Now even HARDER to do
- Willpower depletes, identity persists

**The Lesson from Recovery**

**Observation:**
- People in recovery have changed habits (dramatically)
- They don't rely on willpower
- Core to how: CHANGING THEIR IDENTITY

**White Knuckling:**
- Using willpower to stop drinking WITHOUT working 12 steps
- Exhausting, unsustainable
- High relapse rate
- If they don't use willpower, what DO they do?

**The Identity-First Approach**

**First Words in 12-Step Room:**
"My name is Joe, and I'm an alcoholic."

**NOT about:**
- Habit of drinking
- Willpower to stop
- Behavior modification

**About:**
- Accepting IDENTITY of being alcoholic
- Shifts focus from trying to stop behavior → embracing new identity
- Becoming someone who DOESN'T DRINK
- Not someone TRYING TO STOP drinking

**The Cigarette Test**

Someone wants to quit smoking. Offered cigarette. Two responses:

**Response 1:**
"No thanks, I'm trying to quit."
- Door open for return
- Identity = smoker trying to quit
- Temporary state
- Willpower required

**Response 2:**
"No thanks, I don't smoke."
- Moves further away permanently
- Identity = non-smoker
- Permanent state
- No willpower needed (that's not who I am)

**We Have It Backward**

**We Think:**
Eat right + exercise → eventually become healthy person

**Reality:**
Become healthy person → eating right + exercise follow naturally

**The Shift:**
- Not: "I'm trying to be a coach"
- But: "I am a coach" (then coach-like behaviors follow)

**Identity-Based Habit Change**

### Step 1: Decide Who You Want to Be

**Not:**
- "I want to lose weight"
- "I want to exercise more"

**But:**
- "I am a healthy person"
- "I am an athlete"
- "I am someone who takes care of their body"

**Questions:**
- What type of person has the outcomes you want?
- What would that person do in this situation?
- How would they show up?

### Step 2: Prove It With Small Wins

**Not:**
- Massive overhaul
- All-or-nothing

**But:**
- Small, identity-reinforcing actions
- "A healthy person would..."
- Each rep = vote for new identity

**Examples:**
- Healthy person → orders salad (even if also orders fries)
- Coach → practices asking powerful questions (even outside sessions)
- Writer → writes 100 words (even if it's "bad")

**The Compound Effect:**
- Each action reinforces identity
- Identity makes next action easier
- Upward spiral vs white-knuckling

### Step 3: Let Behavior Follow Identity

**Natural Expression:**
- When identity is solid, behavior flows
- No willpower needed
- "That's just who I am"

**Recovery Example:**
- "I'm in recovery" (identity)
- Going to meetings, calling sponsor, helping others (behavior)
- Behaviors aren't forced—they're expressions of identity

**Coaching Application:**

**Helping Clients Shift Identity:**
- "Who do you need to become to have the life you want?"
- "What would that version of you do today?"
- "How can you prove to yourself that you're already that person?"

**Small Wins Strategy:**
- Identify 2-minute version of desired behavior
- Focus on consistency, not intensity
- Celebrate identity reinforcement, not outcome

**Reframing Failure:**
- Not: "I failed at flossing"
- But: "That wasn't aligned with my identity as someone who takes care of themselves. What happened? What can I learn?"

**Language Shifts:**
- "I'm trying to..." → "I am..."
- "I want to be..." → "I am becoming..."
- "I should..." → "I choose to..."

**ICF Core Competencies:**
- Evokes Awareness
- Facilitates Client Growth

### Deliverables:
- Personal identity statement (your coaching identity)
- Identity-based habit framework
- Small wins coaching guide
