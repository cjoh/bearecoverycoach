## Your Application Is Complete!

Your payment has been processed and your application is officially received.

**Here's what happens next:**

1. **Within 3 business days**, Clay will reach out to schedule your interview
2. **The interview** is a brief, friendly conversation — not a test
3. **Once confirmed**, you'll receive your welcome packet and cohort details

You'll receive a payment confirmation email from Stripe shortly. If you have any questions in the meantime, reach out to [clay@bearecoverycoach.com](mailto:clay@bearecoverycoach.com) or call [(833) 594-7146](tel:8335947146).

**You just took the biggest step.** Everything from here is forward.
