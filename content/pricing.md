## You're wondering if this is worth the investment.

That hesitation makes sense. You've probably looked at other programs. You've compared prices, read the fine print, and wondered what separates one certification from another. You don't want to spend money on something that leaves you unprepared when a real client is sitting across from you, in crisis, trusting you with their recovery.

**So let's talk about what you're actually buying.**

</div>

***

## This Isn't a Course. It's the Foundation of Your Career.

Most certification programs hand you a binder, run you through lectures, and send you out the door. You memorize scripts. You pass a test. Then you sit across from your first client and realize you have no idea what to do when they go off-script.

**The Core Values Recovery Coach certification is built differently.**

You don't memorize — you practice. You work through simulated cases with trainers, learning together how to handle the situations that actually show up in recovery coaching. You practice with 50+ AI clients who give you real, immediate feedback — not a grade, but a mirror that shows you what you're doing well and where you need to grow.

And when you graduate, you don't lose access. You get weekly support and office hours **for life**, as long as you maintain your credential. No alumni fee. No expiration date. You are never on your own.

## What Happens If You Piece This Together On Your Own

People try. Here's what it actually costs:

| Component                                 | DIY Cost           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generic coaching certification            | $1,500–$3,000      |
| Recovery-specific supplemental training   | $500–$1,000        |
| Mentor coaching hours (10 hrs @ $100+/hr) | $1,000+            |
| AI practice tools (if they exist)         | $300–$600/year     |
| Case management software                  | $500/year          |
| Ongoing supervision or consultation       | $200–$400/month    |
| **Total first-year cost**                 | **$3,000–$5,000+** |

And after all that, you still don't have a recovery-specific credential. You don't have lifetime support. You don't have 50 AI clients in your pocket. You have a patchwork — and gaps that show up when clients need you most.

**Or you invest $2,379 once and get everything, for life.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Will this program be accredited?"

We are pursuing ICF accreditation. The current pilot cohort will complete the full professional training program. Once we complete the pilot and receive accreditation, pilot graduates will receive the accredited credential at no additional cost.

### "What credential will I earn?"

You'll earn the Core Values Recovery Coach certification. The curriculum is designed to professional coaching standards. Pilot cohort graduates will be first in line for the accredited credential once it's approved.

### "I've never coached before. Can I do this?"

Yes. The program is designed to take you from zero to competent. The AI clients let you practice hundreds of scenarios before you ever sit with a real client. You won't be thrown into the deep end.

### "Do I need to be in recovery myself?"

Not required. This program serves individuals and families in recovery, and coaches come from many backgrounds. Personal or family experience with recovery is common but not a prerequisite.

### "What's the time commitment?"

20 weeks, roughly 4–6 hours per week. Live sessions run 2–3 hours weekly via Zoom, with the remainder as independent study. All live sessions are recorded if you need to catch up.

### "What if I'm already a therapist or counselor?"

Many therapists add this credential to expand their practice. Coaching is complementary to therapy — a different skill set that opens new doors and new revenue.

### "Can my employer pay for this?"

Yes. Treatment centers and therapy practices regularly sponsor staff training. We provide all necessary documentation for employer reimbursement.

### "What if I need to drop out?"

Full refund within the first two weeks. After that, you can rejoin the next cohort where you left off — no additional cost.

### "How many people per cohort?"

Maximum 30. Small enough for personalized attention, large enough for a real community.

### "When does the next cohort start?"

We run cohorts 3–4 times per year. Apply now and we'll notify you of the next start date.

### Still have questions?

Email [clay@bearecoverycoach.com](mailto:clay@bearecoverycoach.com) or call [(833) 594-7146](tel:8335947146). We answer every message.

## What Happens If You Choose the Wrong Program

You spend less money on a program that teaches you theory but not practice. You get a certificate that doesn't carry weight with employers. You graduate without ongoing support, and the first time a client's situation gets complicated, you're Googling answers alone at midnight.

Cheaper programs produce coaches who burn out, lose confidence, and leave the field within two years. The people who needed them — the individuals and families fighting for their recovery — are left without help.

**The cost of being underprepared is measured in lives, not dollars.**
