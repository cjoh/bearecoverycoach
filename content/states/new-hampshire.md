## <span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">You Want to Help People in New Hampshire Find Recovery</span>

<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">New Hampshire needs recovery coaches. And not just any coaches — coaches who are actually prepared for real clients on their worst days.</span>

<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">Maybe you're in recovery yourself. Maybe you've watched a family member struggle. Maybe you're a therapist or counselor who sees the gap between treatment and lasting recovery.</span>

<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">Whatever brought you here, you know this:</span> **<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">people in New Hampshire deserve coaches who are ready.</span>**

## <span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">The Problem with Most Recovery Coach Training</span>

<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">Most programs hand you a certificate after a weekend workshop. You memorize frameworks. You pass a test. Then your first real client sits across from you — and you freeze.</span>

**<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">That's not training. That's a liability.</span>**

<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">You need more than theory. You need practice. You need feedback. You need support that doesn't expire after graduation.</span>

<span data-proof="suggestion" data-id="m1771086433173_7" data-by="ai:claude" data-kind="replace"><span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">Before you work with real clients, you practice with AI coaches who simulate real scenarios. A client in crisis. A family member in denial. A relapse at 6 months. You get real feedback on your responses — not a grade on a multiple choice test.</span></span>

### <span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">Simulated Cases with Real Trainers</span>

<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">You work alongside trainers on simulated cases, learning together. Not memorizing scripts. Solving real problems in real time.</span>

### <span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">Intervention Techniques</span>

<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">You'll learn the basics of intervention — how to guide families through the hardest conversations of their lives.</span>

### <span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">Lifetime Weekly Support</span>

<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">After graduation, you get weekly support calls and office hours</span> **<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">for life</span>** <span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">(as long as you maintain your credential). You're never on your own.</span>

### <span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">Professional Tools from Day One</span>

<span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">Same Page Notes for client management. SobaSearch for treatment resources. RecoveryCapital assessments. Alumni network and job board.</span>

## <span data-proof="authored" data-by="ai:claude">What Happens If You Don't Get Trained?</span>
