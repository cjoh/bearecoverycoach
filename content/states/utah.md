## You Want to Help People in Utah Find Recovery

Utah needs recovery coaches. And not just any coaches — coaches who are actually prepared for real clients on their worst days.

Maybe you're in recovery yourself. Maybe you've watched a family member struggle. Maybe you're a therapist or counselor who sees the gap between treatment and lasting recovery.

Whatever brought you here, you know this: **people in Utah deserve coaches who are ready.**

## The Problem with Most Recovery Coach Training

Most programs hand you a certificate after a weekend workshop. You memorize frameworks. You pass a test. Then your first real client sits across from you — and you freeze.

**That's not training. That's a liability.**

You need more than theory. You need practice. You need feedback. You need support that doesn't expire after graduation.

## Core Values Recovery Coach Certification

**An ICF ACC based program that actually prepares you for real clients.**

Here's what makes this different:

### 50+ AI practice clients

Before you work with real clients, you practice with AI clients who simulate real scenarios. A client in crisis. A family member in denial. A relapse at 6 months. You get real feedback on your responses — not a grade on a multiple choice test.

### Simulated Cases with Real Trainers

You work alongside trainers on simulated cases, learning together. Not memorizing scripts. Solving real problems in real time.

### Intervention Techniques

You'll learn the basics of intervention — how to guide families through the hardest conversations of their lives.

### Lifetime Weekly Support

After graduation, you get weekly support calls and office hours **for life** (as long as you maintain your credential). You're never on your own.

### Professional Tools from Day One

Same Page Notes for client management. SobaSearch for treatment resources. RecoveryCapital assessments. Alumni network and job board.

## What Happens If You Don't Get Trained?

Without proper preparation, you'll face situations you're not ready for. A client relapses. A family falls apart. You won't have the tools or the support to handle it.

**People in recovery deserve better than that. And so do you.**
