## What Recovery Coaches Do

**A recovery coach helps you build the life you actually want.**

### Primary Role: Forward-Focused Action

You already know what went wrong. A recovery coach helps you figure out what comes next — and holds you accountable to getting there.

**You work with a recovery coach to:**

* Set specific, achievable goals (career, relationships, health)

* Create action plans with real accountability

* Build recovery capital (the internal and external resources that keep you moving forward)

* Navigate life transitions (post-treatment, job changes, family dynamics)

* Design a sustainable recovery lifestyle — not just sobriety, but a life worth protecting

### What This Looks Like in Practice

**Example Session:**

* You want to rebuild the relationship with your teenage daughter

* Your coach helps you identify specific steps, practice difficult conversations, and set a realistic timeline

* You check in weekly on progress

* The focus is on what you'll DO — not endlessly analyzing why the relationship broke

### Training & Credentials

**Typical Path:**

* 60–125 hours of coach-specific training

* ICF certification (ACC, PCC) for professional credibility

* Many coaches have lived recovery experience themselves

* Not licensed — coaching is a distinct profession from therapy

**Specializations include:**

* Family recovery coaching (individuals AND families)

* Executive and professional recovery

* Adolescent recovery

* Trauma-informed coaching

### Cost

* **$75–200/session** (private practice)

* **$40–65K/year salary** (employed at treatment centers)

* Usually out-of-pocket — insurance rarely covers coaching yet

### When a Recovery Coach Is Right for You

✅ **You're stable** (not in crisis, mental health is being managed)
✅ **You want to build something** (career, relationships, purpose)
✅ **You need accountability** (between therapy sessions, or after your sponsor relationship evolves)
✅ **You're post-treatment** (bridging from clinical care to real life)
✅ **You're a family member** (a parent, spouse, or loved one navigating someone else's addiction)

***

## What Therapists Do

**A therapist helps you heal the past and manage the present.**

### Primary Role: Clinical Treatment

When the wounds are deep — trauma, mental health conditions, co-occurring disorders — you need someone trained to go there with you clinically.

**You work with a therapist to:**

* Process trauma (childhood abuse, violence, loss)

* Treat mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD)

* Develop coping skills (emotional regulation, distress tolerance)

* Address co-occurring disorders (addiction + mental health together)

* Receive clinical diagnosis and treatment planning

### What This Looks Like in Practice

**Example Session:**

* You're struggling with panic attacks when you think about drinking

* Your therapist uses EMDR to process the traumatic memory tied to substance use

* You receive clinical assessment, evidence-based treatment, and safety planning

* The focus: understanding why you feel and behave this way, and how to heal

### Training & Credentials

**Required Path:**

* Master's degree (2–3 years: MSW, MA Counseling, MFT)

* Supervised clinical hours (2,000–4,000 depending on license type)

* State licensure exam (LCSW, LPC, LMFT, or psychologist)

* Continuing education requirements

* Professional liability insurance

**Time to practice:** 4–6 years minimum.

### Cost

* **$100–250/session** (private practice)

* **Often covered by insurance** (with a diagnosis)

* Copays typically $20–50 when using insurance

### When a Therapist Is Right for You

✅ **You have co-occurring mental health conditions** (depression, anxiety, trauma)
✅ **You're processing trauma** (abuse, violence, complex PTSD)
✅ **You're in crisis** (suicidal thoughts, severe symptoms)
✅ **You need a clinical diagnosis** (for insurance, disability, or treatment planning)
✅ **You're early in recovery** (first 90 days, high risk period)

***

## What Sponsors Do

**A sponsor helps you work the steps and live the program.**

### Primary Role: 12-Step Mentorship

A sponsor is someone who has walked the path before you. They're not a professional — they're a peer who shares their experience freely.

**You work with a sponsor to:**

* Work through the 12 steps (one at a time)

* Apply program principles to your daily life

* Navigate meetings, fellowship, and service

* Get peer support from someone who has been where you are

* Receive spiritual guidance (as defined by your program)

### What This Looks Like in Practice

**Example Interaction:**

* You're struggling with Step 4 (moral inventory)

* Your sponsor shares how they did their own inventory, and walks you through the process

* You're often in daily contact — phone calls, texts

* The focus: spiritual development, program work, sobriety maintenance

### "Training" & Credentials

**There's no formal training:**

* Personal recovery experience (usually 1+ year sober minimum)

* Has worked the 12 steps themselves

* Chosen by you based on: similar background, program alignment, availability

* No certification, no licensing

* Purely peer-to-peer

**12-Step Tradition:** Service is freely given. Never paid.

### Cost

* **Free** (12-step tradition: no fees, ever)

* Giving back is part of recovery

* The relationship is reciprocal — sponsors benefit too

### When a Sponsor Is Right for You

✅ **You're working a 12-step program** (AA, NA, Al-Anon, etc.)
✅ **You need step work guidance** (from someone who has done it)
✅ **You want peer support** (someone who gets it from lived experience)
✅ **You value daily contact** (check-ins, crisis calls)
✅ **You're focused on spiritual development** (as defined by your program)

## Key Differences Explained

### 1. Direction of Focus

**Recovery Coach → FUTURE**

* "Where do you want to go?"

* "What do you want to build?"

* "What actions will get you there?"

**Therapist → PAST + PRESENT**

* "What happened to you?"

* "How are you coping now?"

* "Let's heal these wounds."

**Sponsor → STEPS + SPIRITUAL**

* "What step are you on?"

* "How are you applying the program today?"

* "What's your spiritual condition?"

### 2. Nature of the Relationship

**Recovery Coach:**

* Professional partnership

* Collaborative, equal footing

* Clear boundaries around dual relationships

* Time-limited or ongoing (depends on your goals)

**Therapist:**

* Clinical boundary (professional distance)

* Confidentiality is a legal and ethical requirement

* Limited self-disclosure from the therapist

* Typically long-term (months to years)

**Sponsor:**

* Can be a lifelong relationship

### 3. Training & Expertise

* More affordable than therapy if you don't have insurance

* Flexible frequency based on your budget and goals

**Therapist:**

## When You Need All Three (The Comprehensive Model)

**The people with the strongest, longest recovery? They use all three.**

### How They Work Together

**Therapist (weekly):**

* Treats co-occurring depression

* Processes childhood trauma

* Develops coping skills for anxiety

* Provides clinical diagnosis and treatment planning

**Sponsor (daily contact):**

* Walks you through Step 4 (moral inventory)

* Daily check-ins (text or a brief call)

* Supports your meeting attendance

* Guides spiritual development through the program

**Recovery Coach (2x/month):**

* Sets career goals (job change, promotion path)

* Holds you accountable for rebuilding relationships

* Helps with family boundary-setting strategies

* Designs a life beyond "just not drinking"

**The result:**

* Your therapist heals the past

* Your sponsor works the program

* Your coach builds the future

* You get comprehensive, layered support

### Real Example: Tom's Recovery Journey

**Tom, 42, alcohol use disorder + PTSD + family estrangement**

**His Therapist (weekly, $30 copay):**

* EMDR for combat PTSD

* Medication coordination with his psychiatrist

* Relapse prevention therapy

* Clinical treatment plan

**His Sponsor (daily texts, weekly coffee):**

* Working Step 9 (making amends)

* Daily gratitude practice

* Meeting attendance support

* Spiritual guidance

**His Recovery Coach (2x/month, $150/session):**

* Career transition planning (military to civilian work)

* Rebuilding relationship with his adult children (specific action steps, not vague intentions)

* Financial planning for recovery (paying off DUIs, building savings)

* Identity work (who am I beyond soldier, alcoholic, father?)

**18 Months Later:**

* Sober — longest stretch at 19 months

* PTSD managed (therapy + meds + program)

* New job in tech (career coaching helped the transition)

* Rebuilding relationships with his kids (coach provided the framework)

* Active in AA (now sponsoring 2 men himself)

**Tom's reflection:**

> "My therapist kept me alive. My sponsor kept me sober. My coach helped me build a life worth living. I needed all three."

## Common Myths Debunked

**Myth 1: "I should pick ONE — coach, therapist, or sponsor."**
**Reality:** They serve different purposes. Most people benefit from multiple supports working together.

**Myth 2: "Sponsors are free, so I don't need to pay for therapy or coaching."**
**Reality:** Sponsors are invaluable, but they can't diagnose conditions, treat mental health, or provide professional coaching frameworks. Different tools for different jobs.

**Myth 3: "Therapy is better because therapists are licensed."**
**Reality:** Licensing ensures clinical competence for mental health treatment. Coaching and sponsorship address different needs entirely. It's not a hierarchy — it's a team.

**Myth 4: "Recovery coaches are just unlicensed therapists."**
**Reality:** Coaching is a distinct profession with its own training, methodology, and approach. Good coaches don't do therapy. They do coaching.

**Myth 5: "If I have a sponsor, I don't need a therapist."**
**Reality:** Sponsors can't treat mental health conditions, process trauma clinically, or provide evidence-based therapy. Many people in strong recovery have both.

**Myth 6: "I can only afford one, so I have to choose."**
**Reality:** Start with what's most accessible. Therapist if you have insurance. Sponsor is always free. Add a coach when your budget allows and you're ready to build forward.

## How to Choose: A Decision Framework

### Start with This Question

**"What do I need most right now?"**

### If your answer is…

**"I need to heal from trauma, abuse, or past wounds."**
→ **Therapist** (clinical trauma treatment)

**"I need to work the 12 steps and stay sober."**
→ **Sponsor** (program work, peer support)

**"I need to build a life, set goals, and move forward."**
→ **Recovery Coach** (future-focused action)

**"I'm in crisis, suicidal, or unstable."**
→ **Therapist** + crisis intervention (possibly hospitalization)

**"I have co-occurring mental health + addiction."**
→ **Therapist** + **Sponsor** (dual support)

**"I'm stable and sober, but I feel stuck or directionless."**
→ **Recovery Coach** (build a vision, create a plan)

**"I'm a family member — not the person with addiction."**
→ **Recovery Coach** OR **Al-Anon sponsor** (family recovery support)

**"I just got out of treatment and need ongoing support."**
→ **All three** (comprehensive care)

## Finding the Right Support

### Finding a Recovery Coach

**Where to look:**

* [ICF Coach Directory](https://coachingfederation.org) (filter for recovery/addiction)

* Treatment center referrals

* Therapist referrals

* Google: "ICF recovery coach [your city]"

**Questions to ask:**

* Are you ICF-credentialed?

* What's your recovery specialization?

* Do you have lived experience?

* What's your coaching methodology?

* What does a typical engagement look like?

* How do you measure progress?

**Red flags:**

* Promises specific outcomes ("I'll get you sober")

* No clear training or credentials

* Crosses boundaries (does therapy, works the steps with you)

* Unclear about cost

### Finding a Therapist

**Where to look:**

* [Psychology Today directory](https://psychologytoday.com)

* Your insurance provider's list

* Treatment center referrals

* SAMHSA treatment locator

**Questions to ask:**

* What's your license?

* Do you specialize in addiction?

* What therapeutic approaches do you use?

* Do you take my insurance?

* Have you treated co-occurring disorders?

**Red flags:**

* Not licensed (verify their license number)

* No addiction specialization (if that's your need)

* Won't accept insurance (if that matters to you)

* Can't explain their approach clearly

### Finding a Sponsor

**Where to look:**

* 12-step meetings (AA, NA, Al-Anon, etc.)

* Ask the meeting chairperson for recommendations

* Attend multiple meetings to find the right fit

* Look for: similar background, solid recovery, real availability

**What to look for:**

* Active in the program (regular meeting attendance)

* Has worked all 12 steps themselves

* Available (can commit to regular contact)

* Similar life experience (gender, age, family situation)

* Chemistry (you feel comfortable with them)

**Red flags:**

* Very early in their own recovery (less than 6 months sober)

* Not actively working their own program

* Boundary violations (romantic or sexual interest)

* Controlling or authoritarian approach

* Sponsors so many people they can't give you real attention

***

## Cost Comparison: 6 Months of Recovery Support

### Budget Option (Sponsor Only)

* **Sponsor:** Free

* **Meetings:** Free (donations encouraged)

* **Total:** $0–50 (optional donations)

**Pros:** Accessible to everyone, no barriers.
**Cons:** No professional support for mental health, trauma, or structured goal-setting.

### Standard Option (Therapist + Sponsor)

* **Therapist:** $30 copay x 24 sessions = $720

* **Sponsor:** Free

* **Total:** $720

**Pros:** Clinical care + peer support.
**Cons:** Primarily past-focused. No structured future-building.

### Comprehensive Option (All Three)

* **Therapist:** $30 copay x 24 sessions = $720

* **Sponsor:** Free

* **Recovery Coach:** $125 x 12 sessions = $1,500

* **Total:** $2,220

**Pros:** Complete support — heal the past, work the program, build the future.
**Cons:** Higher cost.

### The Real Math

**What a single relapse costs:**

* Lost job: $30,000+/year

* DUI: $10,000–15,000

* Treatment: $5,000–30,000

* Relationships, health, self-esteem: incalculable

**Comprehensive support:** $2,220 over 6 months = $370/month.

**If it prevents one relapse, it pays for itself many times over.**

***

## Can These Roles Overlap?

### Sometimes, Yes

**Therapists who are also coaches:**

* Get additional coach training + ICF credential

* Offer both therapy AND coaching (as clearly separate services)

* Maintain clear boundaries: therapy clients get therapy, coaching clients get coaching

**Sponsors who become recovery coaches:**

* Get professional training and certification

* Keep sponsorship free (honoring 12-step tradition)

* Charge for professional coaching (a different relationship entirely)

**Recovery coaches with therapy backgrounds:**

* Common path: therapists add coaching specialization

* Stay in the coaching lane during coaching sessions (no therapy)

### The Key Is Clear Boundaries

**Example: Sarah, LCSW + ICF ACC**

**With therapy clients:**

* Diagnoses and treats mental health

* Processes trauma

* Bills insurance

* Maintains clinical relationship

**With coaching clients:**

* Sets goals and creates action plans

* Provides accountability

* Out-of-pocket payment

* Partnership relationship

**Different services. Different fees. Different scope.**

***

## The Bottom Line

**Recovery Coach:**

* Professional, future-focused, goal-oriented

* Training: 60–125 hours + ICF credential

* Cost: $75–200/session

* **Best for:** Building a life after stabilization

**Therapist:**

* Clinical, trauma-informed, evidence-based

* Training: Master's + license (6+ years)

* Cost: $100–250/session (often insurance-covered)

* **Best for:** Healing the past, treating mental health

**Sponsor:**

* Peer-based, program-focused, spiritual

* Training: Lived experience

* Cost: Free (12-step tradition)

* **Best for:** Working the steps, staying sober, building fellowship

**All three serve different — and complementary — purposes.**

**The best outcomes come when you use all three.**
