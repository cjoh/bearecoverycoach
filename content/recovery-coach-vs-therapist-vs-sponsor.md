## What Recovery Coaches Do

**Recovery coaches help you build the future.**

### Primary Role: Forward-Focused Action

**You work with a recovery coach to:**
- Set specific, achievable goals (career, relationships, health)
- Create action plans with accountability
- Build recovery capital (internal + external resources)
- Navigate life transitions (post-treatment, job changes, family dynamics)
- Design sustainable recovery lifestyle

### What This Looks Like:

**Example Session:**
- Client wants to rebuild relationship with teenage daughter
- Coach helps: identify specific steps, practice conversations, set timeline
- Accountability: weekly check-ins on progress
- Focus: what you'll DO, not why the relationship broke

### Training & Credentials:

**Typical Path:**
- 60-125 hours of coach-specific training
- ICF certification (ACC, PCC) for credibility
- Often have lived recovery experience
- Not licensed (coaching isn't therapy)

**Specializations:**
- Family recovery coaching
- Executive/professional recovery
- Adolescent recovery
- Trauma-informed coaching

### Cost:
- **$75-200/session** (private practice)
- **$40-65K/year salary** (employed at treatment centers)
- Usually out-of-pocket (insurance rarely covers)

### When to Use a Recovery Coach:

✅ **You're stable** (not in crisis, mental health managed)  
✅ **You want to build something** (career, relationships, purpose)  
✅ **You need accountability** (between therapy, after sponsor relationship evolves)  
✅ **You're post-treatment** (bridge from clinical care to real life)  
✅ **You're a family member** (parent, spouse navigating loved one's addiction)

---

## What Therapists Do

**Therapists help you heal the past and manage the present.**

### Primary Role: Clinical Treatment

**You work with a therapist to:**
- Process trauma (childhood abuse, violence, loss)
- Treat mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD)
- Develop coping skills (emotional regulation, distress tolerance)
- Address co-occurring disorders (addiction + mental health)
- Receive clinical diagnosis and treatment planning

### What This Looks Like:

**Example Session:**
- Client struggling with panic attacks when thinking about drinking
- Therapist: uses EMDR to process traumatic memory associated with substance use
- Provides: clinical assessment, evidence-based treatment, safety planning
- Focus: why you feel/behave this way, how to heal

### Training & Credentials:

**Required Path:**
- Master's degree (2-3 years: MSW, MA Counseling, MFT)
- Supervised clinical hours (2,000-4,000 depending on license)
- State licensure exam (LCSW, LPC, LMFT, psychologist)
- Continuing education requirements
- Professional liability insurance

**Time to practice:** 4-6 years minimum

### Cost:
- **$100-250/session** (private practice)
- **Often covered by insurance** (with diagnosis)
- Copays typically $20-50 if using insurance

### When to Use a Therapist:

✅ **You have co-occurring mental health conditions** (depression, anxiety, trauma)  
✅ **You're processing trauma** (abuse, violence, complex PTSD)  
✅ **You're in crisis** (suicidal thoughts, severe symptoms)  
✅ **You need clinical diagnosis** (for insurance, disability, treatment planning)  
✅ **You're early in recovery** (first 90 days, high risk)

## What Sponsors Do

**Sponsors help you work the steps and live the program.**

### Primary Role: 12-Step Mentorship

**You work with a sponsor to:**
- Work through the 12 steps (one at a time)
- Apply program principles to daily life
- Navigate meetings, fellowship, service
- Provide peer support (someone who's been there)
- Offer spiritual guidance (as defined by the program)

### What This Looks Like:

**Example Interaction:**
- Sponsee struggling with Step 4 (moral inventory)
- Sponsor: shares their own inventory process, provides guidance
- Availability: often daily phone calls, text support
- Focus: spiritual development, program work, sobriety maintenance

### "Training" & Credentials:

**No Formal Training:**
- Personal recovery experience (usually 1+ year sober minimum)
- Has worked the 12 steps themselves
- Chosen based on: similar background, program alignment, availability
- No certification, no licensing
- Purely peer-to-peer

**12-Step Tradition:** Service is freely given, never paid.

### Cost:
- **Free** (12-step tradition: no fees)
- Giving back is part of recovery
- Relationship is reciprocal (sponsor benefits too)

### When to Use a Sponsor:

✅ **You're working a 12-step program** (AA, NA, Al-Anon, etc.)  
✅ **You need step work guidance** (someone who's done it)  
✅ **You want peer support** (someone who gets it from lived experience)  
✅ **You need 24/7 availability** (crisis calls, daily check-ins)  
✅ **You value spiritual development** (as defined by your program)

## Key Differences Explained

### 1. Direction of Focus

**Recovery Coach: FUTURE**
- "Where do you want to go?"
- "What do you want to build?"
- "What actions will get you there?"

- "What happened to you?"
- "How are you coping now?"
- "Let's heal these wounds."

- "What step are you on?"
- "How are you applying the program today?"
- "What's your spiritual condition?"

### 2. Nature of Relationship

**Recovery Coach:**

## When You Need All Three (The Comprehensive Model)

**Most people in strong, long-term recovery use all three.**

### The Complementary Approach

**Therapist (weekly):**
- Treat co-occurring depression
- Process childhood trauma
- Develop coping skills for anxiety
- Clinical diagnosis and treatment planning

**Sponsor (daily contact):**
- Work through Step 4 (moral inventory)
- Daily check-ins (text or brief call)
- Meeting attendance support
- Spiritual development through program

**Recovery Coach (2x/month):**
- Set career goals (job change, promotion path)
- Accountability for relationship rebuilding
- Family boundary-setting strategies
- Life design beyond "just not drinking"

**Together:**
- Therapist heals the past
- Sponsor works the program
- Coach builds the future
- Client gets comprehensive, layered support

### Real Example: Tom's Recovery Journey

**Tom, 42, alcohol use disorder + PTSD + family estrangement**

**Therapist (weekly, $30 copay):**
- EMDR for combat PTSD
- Medication coordination with psychiatrist
- Relapse prevention therapy
- Clinical treatment plan

**Sponsor (daily texts, weekly coffee):**
- Working Step 9 (making amends)
- Daily gratitude practice accountability
- Meeting attendance support
- Spiritual guidance

**Recovery Coach (2x/month, $150/session):**
- Career transition planning (leaving military → civilian work)
- Rebuilding relationship with adult children (specific action steps)
- Financial planning for recovery (paying off DUIs, building savings)
- Identity work (who am I beyond soldier, alcoholic, father?)

**18 Months Later:**
- Sober (longest stretch: 19 months)
- PTSD managed (therapy + meds + program)
- New job in tech (career coach helped transition)
- Rebuilding relationships with kids (coach provided frameworks)
- Active in AA (sponsoring 2 men)

**Tom's reflection:**
> "Therapist kept me alive. Sponsor kept me sober. Coach helped me build a life worth living. I needed all three."

## Common Myths Debunked

**Myth 1: "I should pick ONE—coach, therapist, or sponsor."**  
**Reality:** They serve different purposes. Most people benefit from multiple supports.

**Myth 2: "Sponsors are free, so I don't need to pay for therapy or coaching."**  
**Reality:** Sponsors are invaluable but can't diagnose, treat mental health, or provide professional coaching frameworks. Different tools.

**Myth 3: "Therapy is better because therapists are licensed."**  
**Reality:** Licensing ensures clinical competence for mental health treatment. Coaching and sponsorship serve different needs. Not a hierarchy.

**Myth 4: "Recovery coaches are just unlicensed therapists."**  
**Reality:** Coaching is a distinct profession with its own training and approach. Good coaches don't do therapy—they do coaching.

**Myth 5: "If I have a sponsor, I don't need a therapist."**  
**Reality:** Sponsors can't treat mental health conditions, process trauma clinically, or provide evidence-based therapy. Many people need both.

**Myth 6: "I can only afford one, so I have to choose."**  
**Reality:** Consider: therapist if you have insurance, sponsor is free, coach for specific goals if budget allows. Prioritize based on needs.

## How to Choose: Decision Framework

### Start with THIS Question:

**"What do I need most right now?"**

### If your answer is...

**"I need to heal from trauma/abuse/past wounds"**
→ **Therapist** (clinical trauma treatment)

**"I need to work the 12 steps and stay sober"**
→ **Sponsor** (program work, peer support)

**"I need to build a life, set goals, move forward"**
→ **Recovery Coach** (future-focused action)

**"I'm in crisis, suicidal, or unstable"**
→ **Therapist** + possibly hospitalization (crisis intervention)

**"I have co-occurring mental health + addiction"**
→ **Therapist** + **Sponsor** (dual support)

**"I'm stable, sober, but feel stuck/directionless"**
→ **Recovery Coach** (build vision, set goals)

**"I'm a family member, not the person with addiction"**
→ **Recovery Coach** OR **Al-Anon sponsor** (family recovery)

**"I just got out of treatment and need ongoing support"**
→ **All three** (comprehensive care)

## Finding the Right Support

### Finding a Recovery Coach:

**Where to look:**
- [ICF Coach Directory](https://coachingfederation.org) (filter: recovery/addiction)

- How do you measure progress?

**Red flags:**
- Promises outcomes ("I'll get you sober")

- SAMHSA treatment locator

**Questions to ask:**
- What's your license?

### Finding a Sponsor:

**Where to look:**
- 12-step meetings (AA, NA, Al-Anon, etc.)

**What to look for:**
- Active in program (regular meeting attendance)
- Has worked all 12 steps themselves
- Available (can commit to regular contact)

- Chemistry (you feel comfortable with them)

**Red flags:**

## Cost Comparison: 6-Month Recovery Support

### Budget Option (Sponsor Only):
- **Sponsor:** Free
- **Meetings:** Free (donations encouraged)
- **Total:** $0-50 (optional donations)

**Pros:** Accessible to everyone  
**Cons:** No professional support for mental health, trauma, goal-setting

### Standard Option (Therapist + Sponsor):
- **Therapist:** $30 copay × 24 sessions = $720
- **Sponsor:** Free
- **Total:** $720

**Pros:** Clinical care + peer support  
**Cons:** Past-focused, no future-building

### Comprehensive Option (All Three):
- **Therapist:** $30 copay × 24 sessions = $720
- **Sponsor:** Free
- **Recovery Coach:** $125 × 12 sessions = $1,500
- **Total:** $2,220

**Pros:** Complete support (heal past, work program, build future)  
**Cons:** Higher cost

### Value Analysis:

**Relapse costs:**
- Lost job: $30,000+/year
- DUI: $10,000-15,000
- Treatment: $5,000-30,000
- Relationships, health, self-esteem: priceless

**Investing in comprehensive support:** $2,220/6 months = $370/month

**ROI:** If it prevents one relapse, it pays for itself many times over.

---

## Can These Roles Overlap?

### Sometimes, YES:

**Therapists who are also coaches:**
- Get coach training + ICF credential
- Offer both therapy AND coaching (as separate services)
- Clear boundaries: therapy clients get therapy, coaching clients get coaching

**Sponsors who become recovery coaches:**
- Get professional training
- Keep sponsorship free (12-step tradition)
- Charge for professional coaching (different relationship)

**Recovery coaches with therapy backgrounds:**
- Common: therapists add coaching specialization
- Stay in coaching lane (don't provide therapy in coaching sessions)

### The Key: Clear Boundaries

**Example: Sarah, LCSW + ICF ACC**

**With therapy clients:**
- Diagnose, treat mental health
- Process trauma
- Bill insurance
- Clinical relationship

**With coaching clients:**
- Set goals, create action plans
- Provide accountability
- Out-of-pocket
- Partnership relationship

**Different services, different fees, different scope.**

## The Bottom Line

**Recovery Coach:**
- Professional, future-focused, goal-oriented
- Training: 60-125 hours + ICF credential
- Cost: $75-200/session
- **Best for:** Building life after stabilization

**Therapist:**
- Clinical, trauma-informed, evidence-based
- Training: Master's + license (6+ years)
- Cost: $100-250/session (often insurance-covered)
- **Best for:** Healing past, treating mental health

**Sponsor:**
- Peer, program-focused, spiritual
- Training: Lived experience
- Cost: Free (12-step tradition)
- **Best for:** Working steps, staying sober, fellowship

**All three serve different—and complementary—purposes.**

**Best outcomes? Use all three.**
