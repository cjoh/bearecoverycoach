# Disability, Discrimination, and DEIJ Statement

**Core Values Recovery Level 1 Coach Training Program**

## Our Commitment

Core Values Recovery is committed to creating an inclusive, equitable, and accessible learning environment where every participant can thrive. We believe that diversity strengthens our coaching community and that equity in education is a fundamental right, not a privilege.

## Non-Discrimination Policy

Core Values Recovery does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information, marital status, or any other protected status under applicable federal, state, or local law.

This non-discrimination policy applies to:
- Admission to the program
- Participation in all program activities
- Access to educational resources and materials
- Faculty interactions and mentorship
- Assessment and evaluation
- Career development support
- Alumni services

## Accessibility & Reasonable Accommodations

We are committed to ensuring that our program is accessible to participants with disabilities. We provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and applicable state laws.

### Requesting Accommodations

Participants requiring accommodations should contact the Program Director as early as possible, preferably during the enrollment process or at least two weeks before the start of the program.

**To request an accommodation:**
1. Email clay@corevaluesrecovery.com with "Accommodation Request" in the subject line
2. Describe the nature of the accommodation needed
3. Provide any supporting documentation (if applicable)
4. We will work with you to identify and implement appropriate accommodations

### Types of Accommodations

Depending on individual needs, accommodations may include:
- Extended time for assignments or assessments
- Alternative formats for course materials (audio, large print, etc.)
- Captioning or transcripts for video content
- ASL interpretation for live sessions
- Screen reader compatibility for digital materials
- Flexible scheduling for medical appointments
- Adjustments to physical space requirements (for in-person immersion)

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Justice (DEIJ) Framework

### Diversity
We actively welcome and seek out participants, faculty, and guest speakers from diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences. The recovery field benefits from coaches who reflect the communities they serve.

### Equity
We recognize that not everyone starts from the same place. We work to identify and remove barriers to participation, providing resources and support to ensure all participants have equal opportunity to succeed.

### Inclusion
We foster a learning environment where every voice is heard, valued, and respected. Inclusion means creating space for different perspectives, challenging assumptions, and learning from one another's experiences.

### Justice
We acknowledge historical and systemic inequities in access to quality education, mental health care, and addiction treatment. We commit to being part of the solution through:
- Scholarship opportunities for underrepresented groups
- Flexible payment plans to reduce financial barriers
- Culturally responsive curriculum content
- Anti-oppression frameworks in our teaching

## Language & Learning Environment

We use inclusive, affirming language throughout the program. This includes:
- Gender-inclusive language and pronoun respect
- Person-first language regarding disabilities
- Culturally sensitive terminology
- Avoiding assumptions about family structures, relationships, or identities

We expect all participants and faculty to:
- Respect each person's self-identification
- Use preferred names and pronouns
- Create a brave space for difficult conversations
- Challenge bias and stereotypes (including their own)
- Engage with humility and openness to learning

## Reporting Discrimination or Harassment

Any participant who experiences or witnesses discrimination, harassment, or violations of this policy should report it immediately to:

**Program Director:** clay@corevaluesrecovery.com  

All reports will be taken seriously and investigated promptly. We will protect the confidentiality of those who report concerns to the extent possible while conducting a thorough investigation.

## Retaliation Prohibited

Core Values Recovery strictly prohibits retaliation against any individual who:
- Reports discrimination or harassment in good faith
- Participates in an investigation
- Requests a reasonable accommodation

Retaliation itself is a violation of this policy and will result in appropriate disciplinary action.

## Ongoing Commitment

This is not a static document. We commit to:
- Annual review and updates to this statement
- Regular DEIJ training for all faculty and staff
- Collecting and acting on participant feedback regarding inclusion
- Measuring and reporting on diversity metrics
- Continuously improving our accessibility practices
