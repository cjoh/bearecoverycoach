# Complaint and Grievance Policy

**Core Values Recovery Level 1 Coach Training Program**

## Purpose

Core Values Recovery is committed to maintaining high standards of educational quality and professional conduct. This policy provides a clear, fair process for participants to voice concerns, file complaints, or resolve grievances related to the program.

## Scope

This policy applies to complaints or grievances regarding:
- Program content, quality, or delivery
- Faculty conduct or performance
- Discrimination or harassment
- Grading or evaluation disputes
- Billing or financial matters
- Violation of program policies
- Accessibility or accommodation issues
- Any other matter affecting a participant's experience

## Informal Resolution (Encouraged First Step)

Before filing a formal complaint, we encourage participants to attempt informal resolution:

1. **Direct Communication:** If comfortable, speak directly with the person involved (fellow participant, instructor, etc.)
2. **Program Coordinator:** Contact the program coordinator to discuss the concern informally
3. **Mediation:** Request a facilitated conversation with the involved parties

Many concerns can be resolved quickly through open communication. We support participants in these conversations and will provide facilitation if requested.

## Formal Complaint Process

If informal resolution is unsuccessful, inappropriate, or the participant prefers a formal process, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Submit Written Complaint

**Timeline:** File within 30 days of the incident or when you became aware of the issue

**How to Submit:**
- Email: clay@corevaluesrecovery.com
- Subject line: "Formal Complaint - [Your Name]"
- Include:
  - Your name and contact information
  - Date(s) of the incident(s)
  - Detailed description of the concern
  - Names of individuals involved
  - Any supporting documentation
  - Previous attempts at informal resolution (if applicable)
  - Desired outcome or resolution

**Acknowledgment:** You will receive written acknowledgment of your complaint within 3 business days.
