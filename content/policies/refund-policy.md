### Refund Calculations

#### Prorated Refunds
When applicable, refunds are calculated as:

**Formula:**
(Total tuition - non-refundable fees) × (percentage eligible) - (hours attended ÷ total hours × tuition)

**Example:**
- Tuition paid: $1,099
- Withdrawal in Week 3 (eligible for 25% refund)
- Hours attended: 12 of 80
- Calculation: ($1,099 - $50) × 25% - ($1,099 × 12/80) = $262.25 - $164.85 = $97.40 refund

### Payment Plan Refunds

#### Participants on Payment Plans
If participant is on payment plan at time of withdrawal:

**Paid Less Than Owed:**
- Refund calculated based on actual payments made
- Remaining payment obligations canceled
- No refund if payments made exceed calculated refund amount

**Paid More Than Owed:**
- Refund calculated as if paid in full
- Only excess over retained amount refunded

### Refund Method

#### How Refunds Are Issued
- **Original payment method preferred** (credit card, bank account)
- Check issued if original method unavailable
- **Processing time:**
  - Credit card: 5-10 business days
  - Check: 15-20 business days from issue date

#### International Participants

- Violation of Code of Ethics
