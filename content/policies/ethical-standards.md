# Core Values Recovery
## Organizational Ethical Standards

**Effective Date:** February 2026

### Purpose

This document establishes the ethical, integrity, and transparency standards that govern Core Values Recovery (CVR) as an organization and guide all aspects of our ICF Level 1 Accredited Coach Training Program.

---

## Our Ethical Foundation

Core Values Recovery exists to professionalize peer recovery coaching through evidence-based training, professional tools, and ongoing supervision. Everything we do—from curriculum design to student support to alumni engagement—is guided by three commitments:

1. **We serve the field of recovery coaching, not just our business.**
2. **We tell the truth, even when it's uncomfortable.**
3. **We hold ourselves to the same standards we teach.**

These aren't marketing slogans. They're operating principles.

## Ethical Practices in Organizational Culture

### How We Work Internally

**Faculty & Staff Standards:**
- All faculty sign agreements committing to ICF Code of Ethics and CVR standards.
- Faculty are evaluated by students and reviewed annually by the Director of Education.
- We provide ongoing professional development for instructors, mentors, and observers.

**Decision-Making Framework:**
When we face difficult decisions, we ask:
1. Does this serve the student's development as a coach?
2. Does this maintain ICF standards?
3. Would we be comfortable defending this publicly?

If the answer to any question is "no," we don't do it.

**Conflicts of Interest:**
- If a CVR staff member has a financial or personal relationship with a student, they recuse themselves from grading/evaluation.
- We don't accept gifts or payments from students beyond tuition.
- We disclose any partnerships or affiliations that could influence curriculum content.

### How We Handle Mistakes

**When we get it wrong:**
1. We acknowledge the mistake publicly.
2. We explain what happened and why.
3. We outline how we'll prevent it from happening again.
4. We make it right for affected students (refunds, retakes, additional support).

**Recent examples:**

This section will remain empty until we have a mistake to document. When we do, we'll list it here.
