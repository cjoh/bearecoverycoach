# Core Values Recovery Level 1 ACC Program
## Transfer of Credit Policy

**Effective Date:** [To be determined]

### Purpose
This policy establishes guidelines for accepting prior learning and training toward the CVR Level 1 ACC Coach Training Program requirements.

### General Policy Statement

Core Values Recovery may grant credit for equivalent coach training completed at other ICF-accredited programs or through documented coaching experience. All transfer credit decisions are made at the discretion of the Program Director based on alignment with CVR curriculum and ICF standards.

**Maximum Transfer Credit:** No more than 40% (32 hours) of the 80-hour program may be satisfied through transfer credit.

### Eligible Credit Sources

#### ICF Accredited Programs
Credit may be transferred from:
- ICF Level 1 or Level 2 Accredited Coach Training Programs (ACTP)
- ICF Approved Coach Specific Training Hours (ACSTH)
- Individual ICF Continuing Coach Education (CCE) courses

**Requirements:**
- Program must have been ICF-accredited at time of completion
- Training must have occurred within 5 years
- Official transcript or certificate required
- Competencies covered must align with CVR curriculum

#### Non-ICF Accredited Programs
Credit may be considered from:
- University-based coach training programs
- Professional coaching certification programs
- Specialized coaching training (health, executive, etc.)

**Requirements:**
- Detailed syllabus and learning outcomes required
- Demonstration of alignment with ICF Core Competencies
- Completion within 5 years
- Case-by-case review required

#### Prior Coaching Experience
**Not eligible** for transfer credit. The CVR Level 1 ACC Program requires completion of coach-specific training hours, not coaching experience hours.

**Note:** Coaching experience counts toward ICF credential requirements separately from coach training.

### Transfer Credit Evaluation Process

#### Step 1: Initial Request
Submit transfer credit request including:
- Completed Transfer of Credit Request Form
- Official transcripts or certificates from prior training
- Detailed syllabus/course description for each course
- Number of hours completed (synchronous vs. asynchronous breakdown)
- Any performance evaluations or grades received

#### Step 2: CVR Review
Program Director evaluates:
- Alignment with CVR curriculum modules
- Coverage of specific ICF Core Competencies
- Depth and rigor of training
- Qualification of instructors (if available)
- Currency of training (within 5 years)

#### Step 3: Decision
Within 15 business days, participant receives:
- Written decision on credit awarded
- Specific CVR modules/hours satisfied
- Remaining requirements to complete
- Adjusted tuition (if applicable)
- Enrollment modification agreement

#### Step 4: Appeal (if needed)
- Submit appeal within 30 days of decision
- Provide additional documentation supporting request
- Receive final decision within 15 business days

### Credit Equivalency Guidelines

#### ICF Core Competencies Coverage
Transfer credit must demonstrate coverage of:
- Specific competencies at ACC level or higher
- Both knowledge AND applied skill practice
- Feedback and evaluation components

**Partial credit may be awarded** if training covered competencies but lacked practice or feedback components.

#### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Hours
CVR requires 60% synchronous learning. Transfer credit must maintain this ratio:
- If accepting 30 hours transfer credit, at least 18 must be synchronous
- Participant must still meet CVR's 60% synchronous requirement overall

#### Practice and Observation
- Peer coaching practice hours generally not transferable
- Mentor coaching observations not transferable
- Participants must complete all CVR observation requirements

### Tuition Adjustment for Transfer Credit

#### Credit Hour Reduction
Tuition is reduced proportionally for accepted transfer credit:

**Formula:**
Adjusted tuition = Base tuition × (remaining hours ÷ 80 hours)

**Example:**
- 20 hours transfer credit accepted
- Remaining hours: 60
- Adjusted tuition: $1,099 × (60 ÷ 80) = $824.25

#### Minimum Enrollment Requirement
- Participants must complete at least 48 hours (60%) with CVR
- If transfer credit exceeds 32 hours, excess cannot be applied
- Ensures meaningful engagement with CVR methodology

### Documentation Requirements

#### Official Transcripts
Must include:
- Issuing organization name and contact information
- Course title and description
- Number of hours (clearly marked as synchronous/asynchronous)
- Completion date
- Grade or competency level achieved

- All information listed above for transcripts
